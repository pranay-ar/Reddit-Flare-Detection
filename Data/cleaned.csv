Fuck all Religion,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,4198.0,Politics,17885.0,f9outu,pking3,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 
You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 
But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**
Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.
 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 Â°C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 
Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

"Help, ideas needed. HLL poisoned my village with mercury. There have been 250 cancer deaths in just 5 years in just my tiny village. Se[r]ious replies only.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38heyu/help_ideas_needed_hll_poisoned_my_village_with/,257.0,[R]eddiquette,8057.0,38heyu,UnileverCancerFactor,"I don't want to leave this be, and need some help on which NGO's might be interested in fighting this case.
**Background Reading**
* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)
The summary of these articles would be as follows,
A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.
HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.
A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.
What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.
I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 
If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.
I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.
Further studies in case you are interested.
[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 
[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).
>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 Âµg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 Âµg/kg and 8.3 Âµg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.
>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.
This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 
Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.
edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.
To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.
edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.
I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.
Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM.",2015-06-04 19:24:17

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a âdaredevil selfieâ when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 
The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.
**Actual Events:**
Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngstersâ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.
**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.
All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 
I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.
This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 
For Pranita.

Thankyou all for believing this story.
Thankyou guys so much once again, and thanks to the mods for being so cooperative. Thankyou ScoopWhoop for owning up to the mistake and not ignoring the truth when it came out. This post is now being circulated all over facebook and my college thanks to the efforts of reddit India.

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way
* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.
* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan
* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law
* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case
* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No
* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution â Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent â religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries
* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan
* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils
* Doesnât India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve
* Why shouldnât Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category
---
Now, let's address them. 
>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.
That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 
NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048
**[Hereâs Amit Shah saying non-Muslims wonât even need to submit documents for NRC since theyâll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**
>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 
So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 
>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 
>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.
Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 
>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.
That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 
[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugeesâ those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born hereâ fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.
All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 
>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve
Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries.

>Why shouldnât Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category
Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e69fln/possible_scam_on_the_huge_youtube_tech_channel/,313.0,AskIndia,2382.0,e69fln,javapyscript,"Hello everyone,
I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.
I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.
Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.
&#x200B;
Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.
Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""
So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.
Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.
email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)
My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)
Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.
Thanks.
&#x200B;
Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 
Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 
Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 
Update 4: RIP inbox.
Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!
Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today. 
https://imgur.com/a/7VJhBfP 
Thank you so much r/india for all the support in making this happen. All your comments here and on Twitter(and on YouTube too) made it possible for me to finally get the phone. Proud of the community. Thank you :)",2019-12-05 14:43:46
"I made 13 illegal toll booth vanish overnight, milking 3-4 lakhs everyday, using RTI",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8k08vv/i_made_13_illegal_toll_booth_vanish_overnight/,196.0,Policy/Economy,2329.0,8k08vv,Ashishtiwari92,"For decades traveling from native village to the railway station I had been paying toll to cross a bridge, that only kelp on increasing year after year. There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 
So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.
Fun Fact: 
* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.
I could do all these as I was using office address, whose entry was heavily regulated under STPI laws. **It is 10 years now, but I have been told to never talk about this to anyone, else I may get killed.** Crazy.",2018-05-17 14:48:45

People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,144.0,[R]eddiquette,2268.0,ar504q,askquestionsdude,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 
Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):
    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)
CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 
The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).
CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 
>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience
>âWeâre like a body,â he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. âJust because the heart is more important, you canât ignore the knee.â
CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 
>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.
They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.
> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".
TL;DR:
We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 
But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,462.0,Non-Political,2228.0,ciddbn,fuckyallmat,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)
Thanks,
Failure at 25.

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 
And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.
Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

My Covid-19 quarantine experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,158.0,Non-Political,1945.0,ffyots,21Dec1989,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought Iâll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.
This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he letâs me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesnât check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24
A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didnât want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didnât) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.
My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital âheldâ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ânegativeâ for the virus.
The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and youâre away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.
TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 
If you have symptoms, report yourself.",2020-03-10 7:24:34

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.
So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.
 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.
Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 
There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.
Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.
All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words.

"[NP] I called the police and ambulance on a road accident victim. Ambulance shows up in 4 min, police show up in 20.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a3karl/np_i_called_the_police_and_ambulance_on_a_road/,165.0,Non-Political,1862.0,a3karl,masterveerappan,"As described above. Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.
I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.
The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.
So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.
As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.
In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.
The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.
edit : I have a dashcam. [I just uploaded the file here.](https://gfycat.com/WindingNeedyCod)

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi, Karnatka, climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world;
Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;
Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;
Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;
Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;
walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;
Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;
Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;
And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.
They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.
I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.
I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.
The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".
To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.
Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.
Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.
If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 
If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.
Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 
TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.
Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone.

A lady came rushing and went straight to the window , at this moment 10-12 mins must have passed and queue was growing as 2 major trains depart and morning rush hour had begun.
I requested her to join the line and got a reply âtrain is about to come , will miss itâ . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her. At last she had to leave and she shouted the words âIdiot bastardâ and rushed away shedding her pride. Am I the idiot/bastard in this case ? Why do people get offended when they are being simply told to explain simple rules every citizen has to follow. I know this is very common but I am more offended coz of her retaliation.

The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.
**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue:

Just like how you were once new to the internet and you were amazed and puzzled by different things, they will also experience the same, but the difference is that they are like the new student who joined the school in the middle of the year. They have to now put twice as effort than you did in the past because everything has evolved so much and there are so many things to know about.

They are new to everything and they will be naive. They will fall into scams and will be exploited. They will be made fun of as they don't know the social etiquette of the internet which you have got used to. They may not even understand English properly or may not understand the underlying technologies which may seem obvious to you.

However, remember that you were also like that once up a time. Perhaps you were privileged to be able to use the internet while it was still a young new thing, but imagine how you would have felt if everyone you met online were a bully to you. Remember that Internet became what it is because there were forums and sites for helping each other on every topic you can think of.

I am saying this because I often see new users being abused by the Internet as the whole.

5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one.",2019-01-10 10:59:53
Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/,353.0,Politics,1632.0,e5rae3,rehnedeyaar,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder.",2019-12-04 14:42:26

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases arenât that many but theyâre increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesnât. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate âflu clinicâ and donât even see the face of the screening centre. I donât know whether the government canât afford the testing kits or it doesnât want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I wonât test them. Theyâre frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between. I used to be the kind of person who would reach first to the hospital and would be the last to leave but I hate going to work now, I dread talking to people knowing all I am going to do is let them down. Not to mention the hardships I have to face just to reach the hospital from my place of residence because our government has shut down literally every mode of conveyance.

INOX PULLS ME OUT, and left the thugs there. Thank e manager was flippant towards me and when the police got involved he wrote his case report supporting the mob and against me.

The thugs basically write some hit down and are left free. I was detained for bogus charges for not standing up and 'hurting the dignity of the soverign nation'

Not one person stood up for me when a mob threated my life. I am absolutely disgusted with everyone that was present yesterday.

Im still seething from the injustice and urge you all to boycott inox. That was absolutely unacceptable.

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. 

Barun Biswas, a school teacher organized the villagers against these demons. He led the raped women to go to the police and media. The whole village came out to support the teacher in his fight for justice.

After that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.

In 2002, Barun was shot dead by some of the freed members of that gang near Goboardanga railway station while returning from his school. He is a real hero and people of the area still revered him as a legend.

Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 
You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 
But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**
Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.
 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 Â°C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 
Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

"Help, ideas needed. HLL poisoned my village with mercury. There have been 250 cancer deaths in just 5 years in just my tiny village. Se[r]ious replies only.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38heyu/help_ideas_needed_hll_poisoned_my_village_with/,257.0,[R]eddiquette,8052.0,38heyu,UnileverCancerFactor,"I don't want to leave this be, and need some help on which NGO's might be interested in fighting this case.
**Background Reading**
* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)
The summary of these articles would be as follows,
A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.
HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.
A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.
What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.
I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 
If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.
I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.
Further studies in case you are interested.
[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 
[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).
>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 Âµg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 Âµg/kg and 8.3 Âµg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.
>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.
This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 
Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.
edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.
To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.
edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.
I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.
Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM.",2015-06-04 19:24:17

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a âdaredevil selfieâ when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 
The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.
**Actual Events:**
Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngstersâ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.
**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.
All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 
I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.
This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 
For Pranita.

So please accept my sincerest appreciation for what you guys have done today, you have, even though you are hundreds of miles from her parents , reduced their suffering in a small way.

Thankyou guys so much once again, and thanks to the mods for being so cooperative. Thankyou ScoopWhoop for owning up to the mistake and not ignoring the truth when it came out. This post is now being circulated all over facebook and my college thanks to the efforts of reddit India.
 
 To Pranita, 
I hope you are in a better place, the college will forever miss seeing your radiating smile everyday.

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way
* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.
* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan
* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law
* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case
* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No
* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution â Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent â religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries
* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan
* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils
* Doesnât India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship.

It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

Now, let's address them. 
>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.
That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 
NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048
**[Hereâs Amit Shah saying non-Muslims wonât even need to submit documents for NRC since theyâll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**
>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 
So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 
>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 
>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.
Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 
>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.
That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 
[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugeesâ those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born hereâ fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)
>Doesnât India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.
All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 
>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve
Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations.

>Why shouldnât Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category
Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 
So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.
Fun Fact: 
* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,144.0,[R]eddiquette,2260.0,ar504q,askquestionsdude,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 
Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):
    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)
CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 
The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).
CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 
>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience
>âWeâre like a body,â he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. âJust because the heart is more important, you canât ignore the knee.â
CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 
>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.
They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.
> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".
TL;DR:
We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 
But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)
Thanks,
Failure at 25.

Last night, I got done at the gym and went to the supermarket next to the gym to grab some food. After checking out, the cashier pulled me over to the side of the store and took my headphones out from a cubby by the counter. He saw me drop them nearly 2 weeks ago and grabbed them for me.

- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129
I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 
And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.
Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought Iâll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.
This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he letâs me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesnât check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24
A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didnât want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didnât) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.
My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital âheldâ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ânegativeâ for the virus.
The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and youâre away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.
TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 
If you have symptoms, report yourself.",2020-03-10 7:24:34

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.
So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.
 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.
Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 
There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.
Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.
All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words.

Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.
I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.
The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.
So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.
As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.
In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.
The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;
Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;
Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;
And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.
They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.
I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.
I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.
The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".
To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.
Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.
Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.
If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 
If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.
Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 
TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.
Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone. 
*Edit: Just to add, servants should also be treated with respect and dignity. 
Edit Edit: Thank you for the gold, generous redditor. Definitely appreciate the gesture, but honestly, I don't deserve gold for this rant/ post. ",2018-02-28 19:18:13

I think this an every day scene at the counter. I am a daily passenger and I had to renew my quarterly pass , thus I arrived at station 40 mins prior to my train departure. I issue a first class pass but as there were only 20 people I joined the queue and waited for my turn. A lady came rushing and went straight to the window , at this moment 10-12 mins must have passed and queue was growing as 2 major trains depart and morning rush hour had begun.
I requested her to join the line and got a reply âtrain is about to come , will miss itâ . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her. At last she had to leave and she shouted the words âIdiot bastardâ and rushed away shedding her pride. Am I the idiot/bastard in this case ? Why do people get offended when they are being simply told to explain simple rules every citizen has to follow. I know this is very common but I am more offended coz of her retaliation. Also I donât know why 80% of us donât speak up against these literate fools who think they have the right to oppress other fellow citizens.

The college was not so supportive and banks were reluctant because for some reason I can't get study loan between the course, and some have not even replied till date.
I had offered to create app/website for randians in exchange of some loan, but instead the community came together helped me raise enough amount that I could pay my final year college fee, something i never expected from my fav sub.
I really want to thank the mods who helped me with the idea of fund raiser, 25 of you who helped me financially and hundreds of individual who offered useful  advice, kept asking me if I needed any more help, some were even willing to offer me internship/projects to work on to cover my expenses. It's due to r/India that I was finally able to [pay my fee](https://i.imgur.com/cmP1DXM.png) with a fine of Rs. 200 though.
Not only the community where I have spent hundreds of hours helped me in most generous way possible, as a result of my post seeking help, I made few friends and got to talk to experienced individuals who gave me useful advice related to my college, career and the world in general.

Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.

The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.
**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

Just like how you were once new to the internet and you were amazed and puzzled by different things, they will also experience the same, but the difference is that they are like the new student who joined the school in the middle of the year. They have to now put twice as effort than you did in the past because everything has evolved so much and there are so many things to know about.

They are new to everything and they will be naive. They will fall into scams and will be exploited. They will be made fun of as they don't know the social etiquette of the internet which you have got used to. They may not even understand English properly or may not understand the underlying technologies which may seem obvious to you.

However, remember that you were also like that once up a time. Perhaps you were privileged to be able to use the internet while it was still a young new thing, but imagine how you would have felt if everyone you met online were a bully to you. Remember that Internet became what it is because there were forums and sites for helping each other on every topic you can think of.

I am saying this because I often see new users being abused by the Internet as the whole.

"[R] Please don't get Jio Gigafiber, and I have several reasons to say so. I am cancelling my connections and I hope what I say in this post are compelling enough for you to support me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/,477.0,Science/Technology,1654.0,aeblpo,iheartsubmariner,"I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one.",2019-01-10 10:59:53

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases arenât that many but theyâre increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesnât. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate âflu clinicâ and donât even see the face of the screening centre. I donât know whether the government canât afford the testing kits or it doesnât want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I wonât test them. Theyâre frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between.

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. 

Barun Biswas, a school teacher organized the villagers against these demons. He led the raped women to go to the police and media. The whole village came out to support the teacher in his fight for justice.

After that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.

In 2002, Barun was shot dead by some of the freed members of that gang near Goboardanga railway station while returning from his school. He is a real hero and people of the area still revered him as a legend.

But this Baahubali shit... man..I'm dead serious when I say if the Indian public thinks that this is fine film-making - we deserve to be wiped out of existence.  It isn't a poverty thing either - I was at a theatre in the US - and plenty of absolute retards were clapping and whooping at the shitty dialogue and the ""romance"".  
I grew up in India watching plenty of cheesy 80s/90s Hindi movies - and enjoyed many as a kid, and plenty as an adult.  But Baahubali was so far above and beyond in sheer stupidity that I weep for our civilization.  This movie is going to be held up as a ""shining"" example of Indian cinema... I feel like stabbing people in their faces.
------
EDIT - since I see people making ""you like chocolate and I like vanilla ice cream"" type posts, I'll preempt those here - 
Reasonable people can have different tastes. However that logic only extends to a certain point. No matter how ""artistic"" you think your spray of diarrhea on your toilet is, it will never be ""better"" than a painting like the Mona Lisa. You are simply wrong and unreasonable if you find your shit to be ""better"" art than the Mona Lisa. Some things are objectively worse than others - period. Baahubali in this case is objectively inferior to almost any other movie ever made.

Dear Friends, 
This is a very important message if you care about the unity, peace and progress of India. 
In the last few weeks, we've seen that media, especially the English Language channels and newspapers are continuously harping about things like 'rising intolerance' and making a big issue out of some isolated incidents which happened in UP and Karnataka. If you are foreign investor looking to set up some industry in India, you would certainly get scared looking at the evening English news shows (NDTV, India Today etc) and morning English newspapers  (Indian Express, ToI etc).
But on the ground, we the common people of the country don't see any such intolerance or hate crimes happening.  We see that people of all castes, creeds and religions are going about their normal lives without any obstruction from anybody. Since Modi government got elected, no changes have been made to any laws related to social matters. Then why is the media 'manufacturing' these stories of so called intolerance? Why is the media laying the blame at Modi's doorsteps for crimes that are taking place in states ruled by 'secular' parties like Cong (Kar) and SP (UP) ? Why would channels and papers like NDTV, India Today , ToI, IE etc cause damage to the image of India just for benefitting anti-Modi parties like Cong,CPI(M) etc? Here's why :
Pronoy Roy (head of NDTV) is married to Radhika Roy. Radhika Roy is the sister of Brinda Karat of CPI(M). Brinda Karat is the wife of Prakash Karat , ex-head of CPI(M)
Barkha Dutt of NDTV is currently married to Haseeb Ahmed Drabu, who is a PDP politician from J&K
Nidhi Razdan of NDTV is live-in partner of Omar Abdullah, former CM of J&K
Sonia Singh of NDTV is married to RPN Singh of Cong and a former minister in UPA govt
Rajdeep Sardesai of India Today (formerly CNN-IBN and NDTV before that) is married to Sagarika Ghose who is currently with ToI and ET Now (formerly CNN-IBN). Sagarika Ghose is the daughter of Bhaskar Ghose, who was appointed as Director General of Doordarshan by Cong govt. Bhaskar Ghose has been accused of doing financial favours to NDTV, his son in law's employer.
Vishnu Som of NDTV is the son of Himachal Som. Himachal Som was then made Indian ambassador to 'Italy' by Cong govt. Reba Som is the mother of Vishnu Som. She is an 'eminent intellectual'. She has written books about Nehru and Congress.
Vikram Chandra is an anchor and the CEO of NDTV. He has been accused of money laundering to the tune of 5500 Cr for P Chidambaram from the 2G scam loot (link here : http://www.manushi.in/articles.php?articleId=1749#.VjHTuH4rLIU  )
Sitaram Yechuri is the current head of CPI(M). He is married to Seema Chishti. Seema Chishti is the resident editor of Indian Express , Delhi.
Sanjay Jha is the spokesperson of Cong and a frequent face on TV. Rajkamal Jha is his cousin. Rajkamal is the Managing Editor of Indian Express.
I hope now you realise why English language media paints Modi/BJP/RSS as a monster.  I would encourage you to google and verify the correctness of each of these facts. Forward this message to every Indian so that the real evil face of media is exposed. Our media is wolf in sheep's clothes.
Edit1: If inflammatory comments are given, media is not responsible for asking for it ( for their TRP's )

However, this is being blown out of proportion. The current administration was looking for a scapegoat and they found it. We've all seen photos of 10s of thousands of migrants crammed in delhi bus stand. We've seen large public gatherings hosted by BJP themselves (MP govt topple victory party, gaumutra party, ayodhya CM event and many others). On top of that, the failure of central government to plan for anything is shocking. They now have the perfect opportunity to blame Muslims as the originator and spreader an of COVID-19.

This post will be mainly for youngsters who are confused about their future and less for people who are already successful or are already regretting after doing the mistake.
I am a doc. I cleared all the competitive exams and everything back and now enjoy a good wage and respect from society. I have been observing my other classmates who didn't chose engineering medical or CA route and thought of following their passion in all other fields. And I have also spent some time seeing where they are now. Heck even had talk with some.
Your parents are completely justified and correct in forcing you to chose these 2-3 fields. You may be thinking WHAT. But the reality is quite shocking.
These fields are stable and pay handsomely. You don't need to be too great in them, especially medical, to earn a handsome salary. Heck even in engineering, if you are from IIT, average package is 8-10lpa. That will increase and get an IIM and you are set for 18-20lpa on AVERAGE (Do a little hard work and you are set for more. Do bit more and you can even go outside India) . I myself earn around 30lpa. It's not billion but it's average money and enough to survive I guess.
Now I have seen my humanities and other commerce friends with their degrees. By God unless you are at top, forget about even 8lpa. They are having ALOT of difficulties earning good money. They are basically living of their parents money. Some of the good looking ones go in sales and so they get advantage of their genetic looks there.
But overall I have seen that these professions give stability. One of my friend is a musician and he is STRUGGLING HARD. Guy thought he could earn by being an instrumentalist. He forgot he need to only be good at singing but he isn't. 
One is doing mass media and last I heard she was trying to change course due to saturation.
Ofc engineering is having plenty of failiure but getting a NIT/IIT is a bit hard work but a sureshot way of stability and success in life.
That's why your parents aren't against your passion but they are intelligent and prudent and know that money matters in the end and these are the only ways to get them!
Not saying that you can't earn in other profession but get ready to have a TOUGH AND HORRIBLE life especially at start if you do those other professions.",2019-10-14 3:40:42

* a monumental descion was taken without any direct or indirect involvement of the Kashmiri people . You claim kashmir is atoot and,but the warm Kashmiri bodies are an afterthought. 
* forget about involvement,  you basically confined them in an open-air prison. No landline no cellphones no internet . Not even the dignity of TV news so they can learn their own fate .
* most of my friends are toting the exact propaganda that was spewed by the Jan sangh - debelopmant will fix everything  and that kashmirs don't know what's good for them . The fiasco with the facx machine in the governor's office was a smart ploy to delay government formation. 
* the Indian public largely has no malice. But the right wing juices that they have been marinated with over past 5 years have now permeated thinking and is now a dangerous mixture of chuthiyapa and overconfidence and love for paternalism.  Many of my FB friends are solely celebrating( more out of navieness) the fact that one can buy land in kashmir and soon will become the land of milk and honey .the more toxic one are straight up calling this revenge on muslims and eagerly awaiting the demographic shifts.
*Big brother knows what's best for us . Thus is what pains me the most . They have gladly accepted, nay, cheered the onset of authoritarianism.  Modiji knows best to override all constitutional formalities  and representatives . He jailed ex-CMs of the state who were widely considered puppets of the Indian government.  This has happed to Kashmir today. any other state is fair game . He may even do more and more tyrannical acts and people will cheer him on , blinded by the illusion of development and  hate for the ""other ""And I'm sure people will cheer even then . 
No where in the world do you have young people cheering on internet and communication censorship and dictatorial tendencies . I weep for the future of Kashmir and the future of India.

I wanted to extend an invitation for you all to join us over at /r/IndianMuslims.
We're a fairly new sub that are largely focused on issues related to the Indian Muslim community at home and abroad and wanted to reach out to the broader Reddit Indian community. We'd love for our fellow Indians to join us in discussions and exploring our shared history and culture.
As most of you may know, India has the 3rd largest population of Muslims in the world (2nd by other estimates) despite only making 15-18% of the entire population in India. However, this has still led to a lot of misconceptions about the Muslims of India, our culture, our religious views, politics, etc. by both our fellow Indians and the broader Muslim community.
/r/IndianMuslims serves to give the Muslims of India as well as the diaspora of Indian Muslims on Reddit, a platform to discuss the many political and social issues affecting our community. We also aim to explore the Islamic culture of India through art, history, architecture, film, music, food, poetry, and other important factors that make us who we are in relation to India and the wider Muslim world.
All are welcomed, whether you are Muslim or non-Muslim, Indian or non-Indian. It doesnât matter where you live, whether in India, Middle East/Gulf countries, North America, etc., you are all welcomed to be a part of our community.
Hope to see you all soon!

Your perverse honking on roads does not produce noise. Fireworks on Diwali deafen hundreds of people every year. 
A car accident has never ever harmed a human being. A firework accident, though, will instantly kill you. Especially one on Diwali. 
Roadkill is not even a problem for Indian animals. It is the fireworks that scare the living hell out of them. 
The amount of fuel you burn to drive that car of yours is worth nothing. It is only when you buy fireworks that you are ""literally burning your money."" 
Stop this nonsense. Diwali comes once a year, folks. Celebrate it the way you want to. If you're really concerned about the environment, give up your car for one month and take the bus or the train for a change. 
Let people choose how they want to celebrate this festival. I, like all those who possess a little bit of common sense, am aware that Diwali is a festival of light and not that of sound and smoke but I believe that saying no to fireworks is not how you should celebrate. 
You do you, fellas. Crackers or not, this Diwali be happy, safe and sane. :)

Are the students of Jamia Millia Islamia really interested in secularism? Evidence points to the contrary.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee2yz1/are_the_students_of_jamia_millia_islamia_really/,23.0,Politics,3.0,ee2yz1,rahularyarrg,"Over the past week or so, we have seen violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across many states. The one that was probably reported the most was the protest by Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. News channels like NDTV and India Today repeatedly reported how the police used excessive force against âpeacefulâ protesters. We were told that the students were opposed to the omission of Muslims from the CAA and sought to fight against it to âsaveâ Indian democracy and âsecularismâ.
&#x200B;
While going through posts on social media, I came across an interesting piece of information - that JMI reserved 50% of its seats for Muslims. Not having too much faith in the accuracy of social media posts, I wanted to verify if this was really the case. Because if it were, it would clearly show that JMI was anything but secular. And so I started to go through their official websites: www.jmi.ac.in and www.jmicoe.in. What I learnt during my research astounded me. I knew that Muslim institutions gave preferential treatment to Muslims over non-Muslims but I never expected it to be this bad. My article relies solely on the documents and information available on these two official websites. No third parties, no hearsay. All the sources and links are listed at the end of this article.
  
To begin with, the claim that 50% seats in JMI are reserved for Muslims is absolutely true. The following text has been taken from Page 30 of the 2018-19 prospectus of JMI. (as can be seen in the attached image)
  
5.1  
(i) 30% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Muslim applicants.  
(ii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Women applicants who are Muslims.  
(iii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for âOther Backward Classesâ (OBCs) and Scheduled Tribes who are Muslims.  
Note: If seats remain vacant in any program from amongst the 10% of the total number of seats earmarked as per 5.1 (ii) and (iii) above, such vacant seats shall stand transferred to the category 5.1(i),i.e., Muslim applicants.
  
In other words, 30% seats for Muslim applicants + 10% for Muslim women + 10% for Muslim OBC. If there are any vacant seats from the Muslim women or Muslim OBC category, then those seats would be transferred to other Muslim applicants. So there would AT LEAST 50% seats for Muslims in JMI. Why do I say at least 50%? Well, apart from the 50% reservation for Muslims, thereâs 5% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (or PwD). This reservation for PwDs is not limited Muslims only but since the selection of students would be done by the JMI staff, they could opt for Muslims over PwDs from other religions. And on top of that, thereâs 5% reservation for âInternal (Jamia) studentsâ i.e. students of Jamia who have passed their qualifying examination (X or XII) from Jamia Schools. And given that the same 50% reservation policy for Muslims exists in Jamia schools, the students from this category could all be Muslims. So on the whole, there could be up to a maximum of 60% Muslims from the reserved categories.
  
But wait, it gets a lot worse!! There could be far more than 60% Muslims in a program / course. How? Because Muslims can also get admissions in the General category !!! In other words, 50% seats are reserved for Muslims only i.e. only Muslims can opt for these seats. Of the 5% reserved seats for PwDs, Muslims can be given preference. And 5% reservation for internal jamia students would almost certainly be all Muslims. On top of that, there would be Muslim applicants in the General category i.e. Muslims students who opt for admissions not via reservation but in the general category. So in the end, the percentage of Muslim students could be way more than 60%.
  
To find out the exact proportion of Muslim students, one would require the list of all admissions in a particular program / course. I did find the list of all admissions for the year 2019-20 but since those lists display only the registration number of the students and not their name and religion, it cannot be used to determine the exact number of Muslim students. However I did find the list of graduated students for the year 2018. This list mentions the name of the candidates in addition to the registration number. Hereâs what I found:
  
a. In B.Tech Computer Engineering, 37 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 59%.  
b. In B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering, 40 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 64%.  
c. In B.Tech Mechanical Engineering, 43 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 66%.  
d. In B.Tech Civil Engineering, 51 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 78%.
  
Assuming that the proportion of students in admission and graduation would be more-or-less the same, this data not only confirmed my suspicions that the percentage of Muslim students in various courses would be least 60% but went on to show that it may be as high as 80%. I analysed the data for these four streams of engineering. There are several other courses but I did not spend my time analysing each and every single one. For those who are interested to dig deeper, relevant links can be found at the end of this article. 
  
I then looked into scholarships i.e. what percentage of the total number of students who received scholarships were Muslims. Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia (AAJMI) is tasked with providing scholarships for JMI students. I found the list of the selected candidates for the current year.
  
In the first list, out of the 325 selected candidates, 303 are Muslims; which is 93% !!  And in the second list, 96 out of the 99 candidates are Muslims i.e. 97%. In other words, of all the students who received scholarship in 2019, approximately 95% were Muslims.
  
This data conclusively proves that an overwhelming majority of students at JMI are Muslims and that Muslims are given preferential treatment. I wondered if the same pattern holds true for the positions of deans and Heads of Department (HODs). And predictably enough, JMI does not disappoint !!
  
Of the 37 heads of various departments, 32 are Muslim i.e. 86%. And when it comes to the Deans of faculties, 8 of the 9 are Muslim = 89% !! (Annual Report 2017-18)
  
Finally, I went through the list of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors of JMI. By now, Iâm sure you can guess what I would have found. Of the 11 Chancellors since 1920, not one is a non-Muslim. And the same holds true for VCs. Not one of the 15 Vice Chancellors since 1920 is a non-Muslim.
  
So in the end, *60-80% of the students, 95% of scholarship recipients, 86% of the HODs, approximately 90% of the Deans of faculties*, and all the past & present Chancellors & Vice Chancellors of JMI are Muslims !! And yet, they claim to fight for ""secularism"" !!!
  
Ask yourself these simple questions:  
1. How serious can the students of such a university be about âsecularismâ?  
2. Should we as a nation pay any heed to their demands given their shameless hypocrisy?  
3. If they indeed were such strong believers in the idea of secularism then wouldnât they start by secularising their own university first?  
4. Do the students and professors of this university have a moral right to oppose ANY act on the grounds of secularism?
  
For any unbiased reader, this article conclusively proves that the JMI is not interested in secularism in the least. Then why are they protesting CAA? In my opinion, the reasons are:  
1. Supreme Courtâs decision in favour of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.  
2. Belief that Muslims must be loyal to fellow Muslims over the country i.e. Muslim Ummah (or Ummat).  
3. Rightly / wrongly concluding that NRC will be bad.
  
It is also very interesting how leftists / liberals and Muslims have learnt the subtle art of appropriating the Constitution to suit their own agenda. Everybody has heard the accusation that the CAA violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. One can find many Muslims, and non-Muslims, repeating the same crap. It is however very interesting that Muslims are demanding equality and cite Article 14 as the justification. Well, if they are so bent upon equality, then why donât they accept the demand for Universal Civil Code (UCC)? NO!! You see, when the debate is about UCC, they quote Article 25 of the Constitution which gives the right to practice oneâs own religion and claim various special privileges as a religious right; for eg. four wives, triple talaq, etc. And when the discussion pertains to giving citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Islamic countries, they jump to Article 14 !! In other words, they pick and choose that which suits them.
  
So the next time you meet a leftist/liberal or Muslim who says that they oppose CAA because it goes against Article 14 and the principle of equal treatment, ask him if he supports Universal Civil Code. If he denies or gives you a lengthy nonsensical answer as to why he opposes UCC, then he stands exposed ; proving that he / she is not really interested in secularism. 
  
It is amazing that channels like NDTV who claim to present facts as they are have never seen fit to inform Indians about the vastly disproportionate number of Muslim students in JMI. Nor do they call out the hypocrisy of JMI âstudentsâ. If they would have, the whole country would have learnt that these protests have nothing to do with âsecularismâ.
  
Now it is up to us to spread the word. Please share / forward this article so that the truth about JMI is known to everyone.

My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and families of the slain policemen, to the forces who were targeted, and the Indian nation at large. No person should have to receive the remains of their loved ones lost to terrorism.
I am writing this as someone who has been trying to make sense of all of this for quite a few hours now. I am also making it a point to only post it on Reddit because it is easily the most sophisticated form of social media in our part of the world. I understand and completely empathize with the emotions right now, and I'll probably be downvoted, but I wanted to engage with you all in a dialogue in the wake of this crisis that has befallen our beloved subcontinent.
As a Pakistani who grew up in Lahore, I am no stranger to terrorism. I have not only faced it in my hometown, but my family has been a direct victim of it. The nation of Pakistan has paid a huge price to terrorism, home-grown or otherwise. And we continue to do so. Anyone who sympathizes with terrorists is a common enemy of the people of Pakistan and India, and there can never be two ways about it.
Having said that, I'm here to request you to take a deeper look into all of this before you come at our throats for this. I won't deny that Pakistan hasn't been involved in alternative warfare before (we're 1/10th the size of India, with a largely inferior defense machinery, our forces probably deemed it the only way of keeping the Indian advances in check - unfortunate), but this attack doesn't seem like the doing of Pakistan or its forces.
Let's get some context. In recent times, the government has been trying its best to resume dialogue with India. There's the Kartarpur corridor that the government is really trying to push hard on. Also, in the upcoming days, Pakistan awaits MBS from KSA, and with him comes a lifeline for Pakistan. Kalboshan Yadav trial is set to start in a few days, and turning the world against us would do the country no good in the ICJ. And to dig even deeper, Pakistan would not want to give the Modi government a chance to run their anti-Pakistan narrative again and come back into power.
Unsettling the status quo does not work in the favor of Pakistan, or our forces. Maybe, just maybe this is an all-Kashmiri attack this time around? Masood Azhar may have been in Pakistan at some point, but Jaish-e-Mohammad is banned here, and yes, these groups are capable of planning and carrying out activities on their own. Why do I know that? I grew up in Pakistan's decade of terror.
I'm not a military shill. My history on my home sub will portray the opposite actually.I'm just here to request you to take a deeper look into everything before jumping to any conclusions. The media and the politicians will try to sell you a narrative because it works for them. We have all always maintained that Pakistanis and Indians have been kept at each others' throats for years because of our politicians, and not us. Maybe its stuff like this that allows them to do this and keep us this divided?
tl;dr. Don't take the bait, India. Let us mourn this loss with you, and you'll find the people of Pakistan standing by your side in this hour of tragedy. Furthering the war, propaganda and hostilities will achieve neither of our countries anything.  
Edit: To those I may have triggered here, please don't mistake this as a plea for mercy. This is a request to bring logic and reason into the argument. It's time we did that for a change on both sides of the border. Pakistan has more to lose from this attack than you'd realize. I completely understand the emotion, and I do feel your pain, but the threats and words you retorted to is exactly what I'm requesting you to give a second thought to.",2019-02-15 16:39:21
I think everyone in India should learn Hindi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/75v8ou/i_think_everyone_in_india_should_learn_hindi/,77.0,Politics,3.0,75v8ou,IndianLiberal,"Before you freak out, hear me out. I am a south Indian so I have a unique experience with the issue. I was born and raised in Hyderabad and am elsewhere now. So right from the beginning I have learned Telugu (Mother tongue), English and Hindi. I think I can maintain a conversation in Hindi but my accent is bad. I can read and write Hindi quite well.
Everyone should learn their mother tongue first and foremost. So a telugu guy should learn telugu. A marathi guy should learn marathi. That is the first priority.
Now the question is: Should you also learn Hindi? I think every Indian should learn Hindi.
The reasons IMO are as follows :-
1. You can connect with 40% of Indian people. 
2. Only 9% of Indians can speak English. This means you literally cannot talk to you many of your compatriots in the state we are in.
3. If everyone learns Hindi then every Indian can talk to each other. This improves the national fabric and brings us closer to each other.
4. English is and always will be a foreign language. Indians will never be able to truly own and embody a foreign language.
For too long the upper echelons of power in our country were run in English which only 9% people understand. Everyone else has been left out and they feel wronged and rightly so.
Of course, the devil lies in the details. What should be the priority? Even i don't know the answer to that.
Ideally every Indian should speak their mother tongue, Hindi and English and use which ever is convenient. If you are making a political speech in Hindi states use Hindi because you will connect with more people. If you are writing a scientific paper english would be a better choice.

For example, did you know ?
1. Ganesha's trunk is akin to a penis. His belly=Indian male's desire for getting blowjobs.
2. Lord Shiva is a serial adulterer & encourages adultery. His penis is worshipped as Lingam by Hindus.
3. Shiva cut off Ganesha's head owing to a theory explained by Oedipus complex.
4. Holi festival & wearing kumkum by Hindu women signifies violence & a thirst for blood innate in hindu culture.
5. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had gay sex with Swami Vivekananda.
6. Goddess Kali has an insatiable lust for sex.
7. Lord Shiva encourages ritual rape & prostitution
8. Breastfeeding Hindu mothers don't bond with their children like their counterparts in the West do.
9. Everything valuable in Hinduism comes from ""lower castes"" & 'Dalits"". Every evil comes from Brahmins & Sanskrit.
10. Hindus who fight to defend Hinduism suffer from psychological disorders which have roots in their penises. 
11. Sri Ramakrishna placed his feet on Swami Vivekananda's penis. The Hindus mistook this for the mysticism of Ramakrishna
12. Sri Ramakrishna had homoerotic relationships with young boys. Meaning=He had gay sex with his male disciples
13. Sri Ramakrishna's female Guru forced him to have sex with her.
14. Sri Ramakrishna liked to softly rub sandalwood paste on the penises of young boys
15. Stunned by the cocked hips of the boy, Ramakrishna fell into ecstasy.
16. Sri Ramakrishna's attention was caught by a Naga Sadhu's nude body & his penis.
17. Sri Ramakrishna's mystical states were generated by his pedophilia.
18. Bloodthirsty tongue and the self fed breast, homosexual fellatio fantasy in a south Indian ritual tradition=Hindu Goddess
19. Goddess Kali is a phallic being, a mother with a penis
20. Kali is a bloodied menstruating & castrating woman.
21. Ganesha's trunk is a displaced phallus, a caricature of Shiva's lingam.
22. Ganesha is celibate because he doesn't want to compete erotically with his father Shiva, a notorious womaniser #wendydoniger #paulcourtright
23. Like the eunuch, Ganesha has the power to bless & curse. #paulcourtright #wendydoniger
24. Ganesha's appetite for sweets has erotic undertones though there's no story where he's shown to enjoy oral sex. #paulcourtright

That is all I have to say now, the only form of dissent available to me.  I am too small to rally against a government that has power over the public discourse, the tools and purveyors of justice and the very people itself. The government has taken over what I eat, what I see and what I read. It has also slowly taken away what I believe or at least what I used to believe in. The pride with which the mass thumps its chest as majoritarian while also contributing to a dictatorial view of the government that was elected is bothersome. It shows me that what is on paper is not in the minds of people, the rot has now reached a far deeper. There is no more intelligentsia that looks at problems objectively, the best minds converted to conformity or chased away.
What is the pride in defending a country whose economy is about to falter? What is the pride in identifying with a mass? Why is there celebration over a perceived national and religious unity whereas basic necessities are not available to large swathes of the population and the country is built on a tattering education system that only reproduces but does not think? The colour of faith and national pride stops us from seeing the problems that plague us elsewhere, trying to pretend that our problems do not exist or trying to save face before the rest of the world is not a magic pill. The country was built on shaky foundations of poverty and misinformation, the political forces that followed have reaped merry on these resources. This could also be termed as a post-colonial hunt for identity and there is enough theory written, the practice is based on emotion and fear. No amount of sense can be breathed upon a person subsumed by thought control.
Seeing the temple being built reaffirms that there is no longer a future in this country. All for what? A mythical character in a story who would not have cared if one worshipped him or not. Where the biggest issues is of an outside enemy the bigger problems that plague the country go unanswered. Since most of the population does not have a conception of what the Western idea of development is (thanks to shoddy education amongst other things) they are happy to accept what they get at face value. Today it is a mandir, tomorrow it is a pogrom. Who is to care? After all they are the majority and they feel powerful. This will not end here. Kashmir was the soup and this is the starter. It will not end before the Hindutva agenda is firmly pressed down our throats. The new generation will be an anal, flag flying and name chanting drones like the Turkish or Chinese goons that are also baying for blood. The ideals that shaped this country have been distorted and I have no longer have any hope for democracy or inclusion.
I am not siding with this anymore. When the day comes when we hang our heads in shame I will not shrug and repent. Because I am not a part of this madness. The best I can do it to renounce all my affiliation with this ideology from now on. Mark my words for it will Kashi and Mathura next. And who knows what rhyming, emotionally upbeat rally call will be next. I will be called a troll, a Pakistani or shown examples of Israelis or the Muslims. My counter will be, two wrongs will not make a right and I will first try to resolve the problems of my house before embarking on a global change mission. So far I am failing though I hope not for long.

**1. There is nothing to loose.**
Indian army [cannot loose against Pakistan](http://www.debate.org/opinions/can-pakistan-beat-india-in-a-war). Modi has alienated most of the neighbouring countries from Pakistan. [Afghanistan](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Ashraf+Ghani&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=aTLgV-77GIXYvATi6I_4BA#q=Ashraf+Ghani&tbm=nws), [Bangladesh](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=can+indian+army+loose+against+pakistan&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=nTHgV5TxMYbmvgShqoWoAg#tbm=nws&q=bangladesh+pakistan+terror)^[1](https://twitter.com/CNNnews18/status/777837701944909824) have outright condemned Pakistan. Sri Lanka and Nepal are posturing towards Modi. Russia have given a [gesture of support](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=can+indian+army+loose+against+pakistan&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=nTHgV5TxMYbmvgShqoWoAg#tbm=nws&q=russia+india) to India. All the conditions are there.
Secondly, the [Indian forces are superior to Pakistan's](http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&country1=india&country2=pakistan&Submit=COMPARE). India has an advantage in all three forces.
If at all, [it comes to a nuclear war, India has the capability to protect itself](http://www.dawn.com/news/1258707). [At least all major cities](https://in.rbth.com/blogs/stranger_than_fiction/2016/05/30/indias-missile-defence-system-can-bankrupt-pakistan_598529).

There is always political mileage to be gained out of a war. [Mayawati indicated that.](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/narendra-modi-may-trigger-war-with-pakistan-to-hide-failures-mayawati/articleshow/53902829.cms)
Secondly, it is just the continuation of Mr. He who must not be named policy in Gujarat, the Gujrat model of development, on a pan Indian scale. Sorry, no sources here.
And most importantly, Modi can look towards a resolution to Kashmir, in favorable terms. This he will make sure if India has the upper hand before truce.

I am one of those haters and through this post I want all of you to walk through my mind so you know the reasons on how I or any other Islam-hater became one.
Lets start from when I was a fairly neutral hindu guy.I believed in(still do) that all religions are equal,for they are different means to same god.I was as secular as a good Hindu/Sikh could be. 
Then I hear about what muslims did to Kashmiri Pandits.How they killed them and threatened them to either convert or fuck off from their 1000 year old homeland.I found out about how mob of them killed 60 innocent hindu pilgrims which initiated the 2002 Godhra riots.About how they raped a hindu girl and killed her brothers(reason for Mujaffarnagar riots).Currently these Muslims are busy playing riot-riots with Sikhs when the court orders were unfavourable to them.
Not to mention what they are doing outside India - killing,converting minorities in Pak since Independence,terrorizing whole world with organisations like Al-Qaeda,Boko Haram and ISIS.
Muslims are doing these kind of chutiyapas all over the world and you still want me to believe they are religion of peace? Get your mind checked.
You say these are acts of only few and blaming whole Islam is not justified? 
How many more instances do you want before you drop your argument of *don't generalise muslims*? I would be happy to serve you more mate,I have plenty.
Islam is one big-time fucked up religion which will never be in peace with others.You know why? Because their holy texts doesn't preach so.People of a religion are as good as their holy text,for it is what guides their behaviour.Hindus are peaceful and secular because of Vedas,Sikhs for Guru Granth Sahib and so on for Buddhists and Jains.And what does Koran teach? To kill and hate non-believers for they don't realise greatness of Islam? 
What kind of Kuran is it which tells followers to deny equal rights to women while their men can fuck and marry as much girls as they want?
Why don't muslims questions these kind of practices ? Why do they take them for granted as 'order of god' ? Every religion has questioned wrong practices in their books and have modernized with time.So,why muslims are trying to live in 21th century with a 7th century self-help book?",2014-07-29 21:13:05

I am a Sikh. By my faith, I am forbidden to eat halal (or kuttha) meat. Besides religious reasons, and without meaning to impugn a Muslim or a Jew's faith, halal or kosher meat is produced using [some rather unpleasant methods](http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&assetId=1232719611043&mode=prd) and has faced [scattered bans] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2562350/Denmark-accused-anti-Semitism-bans-religious-slaughter-animals-kosher-halal-meat.html) all over the world, or debate with [scientists attesting to its inhumane nature](http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/121177,Scientists-claim-kosher-and-halal-animal-slaughter-is-inhumane-and-cruel).
While I was in the US, it was almost a given that fast food meat would be halal/kosher. Companies see this as a cost saving measure as Christians do not care one way or another.
The other day, I was at a KFC and saw to my horror a small sign on the right hand side of the ordering counter stating that the chicken used in the restaurant is halal (or verbiage to that effect). Yes, it is visible to the public but how many of you look 90 degrees to the right (or left) when in a queue ordering food? Its deceptive - it should be prominently displayed right above the menu.
Observant Sikhs do not eat halal. I am not sure about Hindus (some tell me that they have a similar ban, most say that they don't care). But I think that everyone ought to be aware of this before indulging in some KFC. I have read that McDonald is the same.
That this is happening in a part of India where Muslims comprise less than 5% of the population (and I can assure you - most patrons of KFC etc. are not Muslims) and there are almost no kosher-keeping Jews, is itself a curiosity.",2014-06-29 23:44:59

2) Why didnt Bolloywood or any Indian media think of organising some fundraiser like this where they would make calls to prominent philanthropists and Indian tech companies asking for donations.

Take the now popular BBC documentary - perhaps the idea is proposed from a good intention of exposing the issues involved, but somebody sees the opportunity, greases some palms, and involves themselves; maybe they change the content slightly to generalize things beyond the incident it's based on, maybe they simply ensure it's marketed in a way that's helpful to their own propaganda. It's even possible that our govt came across some intelligence of such ideas planned based on the documentary, leading to the much-maligned ban - I have no evidence to believe this, I'm just saying that a lot of things could be going on behind the scenes.
The US definitely understands the power of media in the modern world, and India and China are the two major nations that are perceived as new and developing threats to US. 
""Rape epidemic"" was a bad enough term, but by tagging us as a ""rape culture"" entirely, India is affected on multiple fronts: 
* Tourism - a segment this govt sees the potential of (see ""Swacch Bharath"" and comments by PM elsewhere) - will be paralyzed entirely as people automatically think ""rape"" when they think of India. 
* Whether or not this ""German professor"" thing is true, if this ""rape culture"" tag is allowed to enter the popular consciousness, such things will factor in at least unconsciously in the minds of deciding authorities - when deciding university admissions, job interviews, visa interviews, etc., all of it dampening India's growth. 
* If a mass hysteria builds, people get emotional, and demand lots of visible and psychologically satisfying security in place - which is what is called ""security theater"". So, the administration's resources would have to be wasted on ""security theater"" rather than actual security, which again slows growth. 
I don't know how much of a probability I myself will attach to this theory, but I hope this at least gets some of you thinking about such possibilities. [Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Operations_%28United_States%29#Cold_War) a small subset of the US's PsyOps done decades ago, I hope you can extrapolate how much went unexposed and how much their techniques would have been ""improved"" in the decades since.

Reality : As these are purchase related work orders, they were not put on the govt. website. In the tenure of the previous governments also, Govt. Resolutions related to any of the purchases were not put on the website
3. Allegation : The purchase was approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha
Reality : The rate contract was approved on verification of all the points associated with the manufacturing units of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha by the Technical Team of the CSPO. The Women and Child Development Department has also verified the unit. Therefore the allegation that the purchases were approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity is wrong.
4. Allegation : The purchase from M/s Bhavani Enterprises was approved in only one day
Reality : Rate Contract is available for M/s Bhavani Enterprises and therefore the purchase was approved. However, the propaganda being made in this regard is completely false. The purchase from M/s Bhavani Enterprises was approved on the basis of Govt. Rules and Laid Down process.
5. Allegation : The contracts were allotted to unauthorized Firms
Reality : This allegation is also an utter falsehood. The purchase orders were allotted to the firms authorized in Rate Contracts provided by the approved agencies. Contracts are not allotted to any unauthorized firm.
6. Allegation : M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. does not have copyright registration
Reality : Shree Tekawade has done the copyright consent agreement with M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. In this, as per the Terms and Conditions of the contract, the rights for printing, selling, and publication of the associated books are available with M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd and therefore purchase order was given to M/s Jagadguru Printing Press.
7. Allegation : Cheque of value of Rs. 5.6 crores was credited into the account of the contractor
Reality : This allegation is also a complete falsehood. The Commissioner of Women and Child Development has issued the cheque in the same of the associated firm i.e. M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. The cheque was not issued in the same of any individual.
8. Allegation : The Water Filter of value Rs. 4500 was purchased at Rs. 5200.
Reality : The Govt. Rate contract mentions the cost of Water Filter at Rs. 4500/- and Water Filter with Storage Capacity at Rs. 5200/-. The water filter with storage capacity has been purchased and therefore the allegations made in this regard are baseless and misleading for the people. The water filter with storage capacity has been done based only on the costs mentioned in the Rate Contract.
9. Allegation : M/s Suryakanta does not have its plant to manufacture Chikki
Reality : M/s Suryakanta has its own plant. This plant is at Vengurla and it has been verified.
10. Allegation : The provision for Medical Kits was for Rs. 500 and yet, Rs. 720 were charged.
Clarification: This allegation is also completely false and misleading. Medical Kits have been purchased based on the provisions of the Central Govt. at Rs. 599/-. As per the Terms and Conditions mentioned in the Tender, The Commissioner (Integrated Child Development Scheme) has the rights to change the quantity of the Medicines and the cost of Medical Kit was reduced to Rs.599/- from Rs. 720/- to fit into the limit of Central Govt. of Rs. 600/-.
Misinformation in regards to eTendering
The state govt. has issued a GR through General Administration Department on 18. December 2014, making it mandatory for carrying out purchases above Rs. 3 Lakhs. However, this tender is for carrying out e Tendering instead of paper based Tendering for all purchases above Rs. 3 Lakhs and therefore for any of the purchases, if the Rate Contracts are already available, e Tendering is not required. The purchases done by the Women and Child Development Department are as per the Rules and Regulations as mentioned above. These purchases are done on the basis of the Rate Contracts finalized by the Director General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS & D) of the Industries Department and Central Government. Also, all the purchases were made in FY 2014-15 i.e. before March 2015.
However, the Government Orders, making e Tendering mandatory for any purchases above Rs. 1 Crore even if the Rate Contract are available, were issued after this period, i.e. on 17. April 2015. However, it may be noted that the above purchases were done before March 2015. Therefore the question of carrying out eTendering for purchases above Rs. 1 Crores did not arise.
If the decision of the aforementioned purchases was not taken, it would not have been possible to utilize the funds in the then current Financial Year i.e. before 31. March 2015. These funds would have been lapsed and the funds would not be available for the anganwadi children and the funds would have been available only in the new financial year with a delay. The Central Govt. share in this funds would have been lapsed and would not have be available again. In the mean time, the beneficiaries of this schemes would be completely neglected and the supplies would have been shut for them.
The purchases of the previous govt. on the basis of the same Rate Contract
It may be noted that the Rate Contract used for above mentioned purchases were finalized in the time of the previous Congress-NCP Govt. Also, the previous Congress-NCP Govt. did purchases on the basis of the same Rate Contracts. It needs to be understood that the purchases of Rs. 164 Crores in 2012-13, Rs. 127 Crores in 2013-14 ad Rs. 56 Crores in June-July 2014 have been made.
Therefore the news is completely baseless and far from reality.",2015-06-27 10:52:18

We get assignments to run a campaign against someone or bury a dirty work of someone. We work with from large politicians to biggest Indian companies. I am based in B'lore. So thats about me. 
AMAA! No details about me, my company or past jobs I did. I am not taking any names. 
The whole net neutrality chapter was really good and I was glad to see majority of Indian Internet Netizens come online to support something. Obviously I was happy cos this gave me opportunities. So... We got a assignment to turn this whole thing against Flipkart. And I did it successfully. I first started it with Whatsapp forwards. We built pretty graphics and forwarded them. Then I started with twitter and facebook. trust me, we were not only the firm who did this ;)
Two of the twitter hashtags I started trended nicely. I paid one of the FB pages, who posted 'Get well soon Bansals' and asked people to send flowers (I picked this idea from /r/india itself). Well, few people did actually send flowers to FK office. 
I am active on randia from many years. The teenagers here are very naive. Thats why I posted here. Don't trust blindly anything on media you see. You never know how you are getting used or being manipulated. It was not just FK who were against NN. Snapdeal was quite whole the time, watching how it will be. So, according to my sources, they were also planning to tie up with Airtel. Homeshop18, PayTM, Freecharge etc etc. Amazon also breaks NN, how come there were no campaigns against it? Why not against Google or Facebook? Or even Google India or Facebook India? Or directly against Airtel or Reliance? I am pretty sure these thoughts never came to you. As soon as Flipkart backed out, the whole thing toned down so slow and almost died. Have you observed this? 
So, AMAA! 
Edit: Despite all the personal attacks against me, I have answered all the questions. I will be online again in evening.

Serious question and I want a decent discussion without people calling me names like RSS agent or Bhakt: CMV: The idea that India is becoming a fascist state is absolute tosh.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8n8ohz/serious_question_and_i_want_a_decent_discussion/,68.0,[R]eddiquette,2.0,8n8ohz,Atauturk24,"So, firstly people about myself.
I am an Iraqi who after growing up in Iraq under the heels of the mullahs who screwed up my entire nation escaped to Turkey and from there on shifted to London.
Over there I encountered the Indian diaspora and moved in with a Indian roommate \( from hyd\)
Now, I always wanted to know about people who decided it was their right to establish a caliphate in my country and turn into a complete wasteland and hence began looking into the subcontinent affairs
Imagine my shock when I first encountered Hindi Muslims telling me that they were of Arab ancestry \( one even showed me a family tree which was allegedly passed onto him from the times of Prophet Adam \( the first man \)
Anyway that is a separate issue, but having recently become involved with both ur's and America's politics, I am astounded to see the Indian liberal or self proclaimed leftists have more in common with Iraqi mullah right wingers \( same in America\)
Also, the idea that Modi and Trump are some kind Hitler like figures is absolute tosh and ridiculous
Firstly can any1 please tell me when at any point of history has a fascist head had dissenters leave alone at 4 years in his term but even before coming to power.
Be it Hitler, Pinochet,  Mao every one of them had popularity and none dared oppose them.
Even my country's people accepted Saddam.
Indian and American left are the only 2 groups who make the bold claim to have stopped the fascist head of state from completely taking over ever in history.
Also can any1 tell me when in ANY POINT OF HISTORY have minority groups under persecution been able to be openly hostile to the party in power
HECK U HAVE CLERGY openly putting bounty's on his head, even awarding money for beheading his party members.
Could jews do it in 30's Germany, Shias under Saddam, hindus in Pakistan, Christians in ME, COMMUNISTS under Pinochet.
THIS IS ALSO imp, can any1 tell me when in history have a persecuted group run to a nation that is persecuting them.
India \( Burma Muslims \) and USA \( REFUGEES\) 
The idea that military style takeover will happen \( aka hitler \) under Modi is laughable
Fascist state emerges when a group of people decide to exploit natural resources and want cheap bonded labour or serfdom working for them
Pinochet for Chile Copper Mines.
Also Bonded labour which is the primary goal for a fascist state already exists in the form of dalits working in one of ur major natural resources of India \( agriculture\)
Plus for a miliraty or martial rule to apply it can be done only on a small state which is small in size and whose population can be controlled
India and US are way big in size and no way can the state control the local population.
1 or 2 states yes, the entire country, no fucking way.",2018-05-31 3:14:52

This was a man I indeed held in very high esteem - until today, that is because today I learned that many of his views were eerily similar to right-wing extremist Hindutva chickenhawks (sanghis) -
* **He believed Hinduism and India to be cradle of all civilization, the source of all knowledge, literature, mathematics etc.**
 >I am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the Ganges, - astronomy, astrology, metempsychosis, etc... It is very important to note that some 2,500 years ago at the least Pythagoras went from Samos to the Ganges to learn geometry...But he would certainly not have undertaken such a strange journey had the reputation of the Brahmins' science not been long established in Europe.
 â Voltaire, Lettres sur l'origine des sciences et sur celle des peuples de l'Asie (first published Paris, 1777), letter of 15 December 1775.
* **He considered the Islamic invaders of India as ""barbarians""**
 >No sooner than India begin to be known to the Occident's barbarians than she was the object of their greed, and even more so when these barbarians became civilised and industrious, and created new needs for themselves.... The Albuquerques and their successors succeeded in supplying Europe with pepper and paintings only through carnage
 â Voltaire, Fragments historiques sur l'Inde, op.cit., p.383
* **He was very fond of Hindus and Hinduism**
 In contrast to his views on their invaders, he viewed Hindus as ""peaceful and innocent people, equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves"". 
 He also said about Vedas that ""The Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East"".
* **His views on Christianity and Islam**
 He wrote this about Christianity in a letter to King of Prussia -
 >**[Christianity] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world.** Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. â¦ My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out..
 His opinion about Islam wasn't much better.
 He described Mohammed as a ""deceitful character."" He wrote that **Mohammed was ""whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command.""**
 He considered Quran to be ignoring the laws of physics. Thus, there are a number of representations of Mohammed by Voltaire, a religious one, according to which Mohammed is a prophet like the others, who exploits people's naivety and spreads superstition and fanaticism, and the other a political one, according to which Mohammed was a legislator who brought his contemporaries out of idolatry. According to Diego Venturino, Voltaire applauds the legislator but hates the conqueror and the pontiff, who established his religion through violence.

While everyone was criticizing this move, there was this one uncle who stood his ground that emergency time was not at all bad for the common man, in fact it was very good.
This uncle used to work in a public sector bank at that time and he says that efficiency of working improved a great deal, employees started coming to offices on time, and worked hard. Corruption had reduced to almost non-existent levels as corrupt employees were afraid of taking bribes because now the govt. agencies had increased powers to arrest them. Be it traffic cops, railway clerks or bank employees, everyone worked efficiently and the end result was a better society for the common dude who worked honestly.
The only people who weren't happy with emergency were political opposition and the media. Political opponents did come together in the form of JP movement (just as maha-gatbandhan is now) but that movement fizzled out soon because there was no ideological unity among them, except everyone wanted Indira Gandhi to go.
As for media, they seemed to be the most hurt, hence they took revenge on the govt. and portrayed emergency in a very negative light. It wasn't all that bad if a lot of people are to be believed.",2018-12-05 18:35:05

Here's my take on this whole AIB Tanmay issue.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6nkemu/heres_my_take_on_this_whole_aib_tanmay_issue/,62.0,AskIndia,0.0,6nkemu,chota_ravan,"So since couple of days this AIB incident has picked up quite a bit of pace since Congress has jumped in the issue. I've seen like 3 posts on Randia discussing on the same issue. I want to share what I've noticed and how we are looking for the convenient bashing to pour out our anger or possibly targeted anger. I am not associated with any party btw.
Now coming to the issue. Its unfortunate. That's only I can say for the original tweet of Tanmay Bhatt. Randians are getting carried away into believing that this whole issue was only because of Dog Filter on snapchat. Well at least that's what people are trying to discuss all over Randia and making it a FOE argument.
What no is talking about is that TB used an innocent man's picture who probably looked like Modi and mocked him on Social media most probably without taking his permission to use the photo. (He has not clarified whether he took the permission or not and I doubt that person will allow to use his photo to become a laughing stock on the internet.)
Now here I find it is morally and ethically wrong to use some innocent man's photo to target some other person in this case Modi to score some brownie points on the internet. Whoever posted his original picture probably without his permission just so he can use him to target someone else in this case Modi is also at fault but Since TB is running a startup on Internet, has quite a bit of good fan following. Shouldn't he be more careful and responsible about such stuff?
What I find ironic is that Congress has jumped in this issue to score their political goals thinking this is good for their publicity and revival of their party in the upcoming election. Its amusing since many Congressis have uploaded ""their"" picture with dog filter to troll their opponent. People started trolling as well. It probably became a pissing contest which is kind of disgusting IMO. But no one thought about that old man whose picture is being circulated on the Internet and how he might be feeling in all this.
Now I've seen like 3 top threads on Randia being discussed on the same issue as I have said earlier but I have not seen the same amount of outrage for that 17yo boy who got arrested in Bengal. Seems like FOE rant is justified based on the ability to manipulate the incident in the favor of those who wants to take advantage out of it.
This is just what I observed and I wanted to share it with my Randian fellows. There might be many errors so kindly pardon me. This was written in haste. No hard feelings friends.
Edit: Seems I am being continuously down voted. Randia is not what it use to be.
Edit2: Looks like a political party's social media cell is continuously down voting my post. You still can't suppress my voice. Kindly apply logic above your party politics.",2017-07-16 17:55:50

Criminal Charges against AAP candidates in Delhi elections and the hypocrisy of their fanboys,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2udrc5/criminal_charges_against_aap_candidates_in_delhi/,83.0,Politics,1.0,2udrc5,thelazyreader2015,"AAP was founded as an anti-corruption movement. They make a big deal about introducing clean, new politics to India. They make an even bigger deal about criminal charges and accusations(real or imaginary) against leaders and candidates of other parties. **In fact they and their supporters are prone to act as if any criminal charges and accusations against other parties, especially BJP, are automatically 100% true and they are guilty by default.**
So it is really curious that so many of AAP's own candidates have criminal charges in these elections and the same AAP leaders and same supporters turn HYPOCRITE and desperately defend them instead of asking their party to investigate these charges.
[27 BJP, 21 AAP, 12 Congress candidates in Delhi elections have criminal cases](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/27-bjp-21-aap-12-congress-candidates-in-delhi-elections-have-criminal-cases/)
The behavior of the AAP fanboy army is unbeleivable. The same mouths that pretend all 27 BJP candidates are crooks also say things like *'These charges against AAP candidates are ONLY FOR PROTESTS!'* and *'These are all FAKE charges, AAP members are all INNOCENT!'* or *'GIMME PROOF, only the 21 AAP candidates need PROOF, other parties are GUILTY until proven innocent!'*
This is the full report on criminal charges against candidates in the Delhi elections.
http://adrindia.org/download/file/fid/4294
Just for perspective, let's go over the criminal charges against a few AAP candidates. They are quite serious,
**1 ) Arvind Kejriwal (New Delhi)**
-4 charges related to rioting (IPC Section-147)
-4 charges related to Assault or criminal force to
deter public servant from discharge of his duty
(IPC Section-353)
-3 charges related to Rioting, armed with deadly
weapon (IPC Section-148)
-2 charges related to Assaulting or obstructing
public servant when suppressing riot, etc. (IPC
Section-152)
-1 charge related to Wantonly giving provocation
with intent to cause riot-if rioting be committed-if
not committed (IPC Section-153)
**2 ) Manish Sisodia(PATPARGANJ)**
-3 charges related to rioting (IPC Section-147)
-3 charges related to Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty (IPC Section-353)
-2 charges related to Rioting, armed with deadly weapon (IPC Section-148)
-1 charge related to Assaulting or obstructing public servant when suppressing riot, etc. (IPC Section-152)
-1 charge related to Wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot-if rioting be committed-if not committed (IPC Section-153)
**3 ) Sahu Ram(TUGHLAQABAD)**
-1 charge related to criminal intimidation (IPC Section-506)
-1 charge related to Voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty (IPC Section-332)
-1 charge related to House-trespass in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment (IPC Section-451)
-2 charges related to rioting (IPC Section-147)
-2 charges related to Rioting, armed with deadly weapon (IPC Section-148)

-1 charge related to Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property (IPC Section- 420)

-1 charge related to rioting (IPC Section-147)

I realize that with their mental conditioning most AAP fanboys will just downvote without reading or spew abuse against me. And that the massive AAP social media machine will quickly mobilize trolls from across facebook, twitter and reddit to bury this post for the sake of their 'honest politics'.
**But I appeal to anyone *genuinely* concerned about clean politics: Please read this post and read the link I have given.** I have checked the report thoroughly and there are indeed 21 AAP candiates with criminal charges, of which many are serious.
-Rioting
-Assault
-Criminal Intimidation
-Cheating
-Counterfeiting money
-Death by negligence
-Sexual assault
And so on. **Please think before posting: If these people did not belong to AAP would you automatically declare them as innocent and wrongfully accused? Or would you be skeptical of them and their 'clean' politics?**
And **whatever excuses you make in favour of AAP, would you make the same for candidates from other parties or do you apply a different set of standards for judging them?**

For a country located nearly 3000 miles away, these Muslims sure care a lot about Israel and Palestinians.
OK ... time for a history lesson.
1947- Muslims cause the partition of India. Riots happen across the subcontinent because of Jinnah's appeal for ""[Direct Action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Action_Day)"". No Muslim outrage.
1948 - Despite being majority, [Hindus routinely killed and raped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#During_the_era_of_Nizam_state_of_Hyderabad) in Hyderabad. No Muslim outrage.
1971- Pakistan's muslim army kills lakhs of [Hindu men and rapes lakhs of Hindu women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide). No Muslim outrage.
1985- A [62 year old muslim woman and her 5 children gets denied maintenance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohd._Ahmed_Khan_v._Shah_Bano_Begum) by her husband, due to the pressure of Orthodox Muslim groups. No Muslim outrage.
Lets skip a few years and come into the 21st century-
2002- Muslims [burn a train full of hindu pilgrims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhra_train_burning), for no reason at all. No Muslim outrage.
2012- Muslims [destroy a war memorial](http://shariaunveiled.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/india-mumbai-war-memorial-resized.jpg) in Mumbai, under the pretext of protesting Assam riots. No Muslim outrage.
2013-Muslims riot in Muzaffarnagar after they kill two Hindu boys for protesting against harassment of their sister. They burn shops, rape women. No Muslim outrage
2014- Muslims riot in Saharanpur after they were unsuccessful in occupying a land that belonged to the Sikhs and was to be used for a Gurudwara. They plunder shops, set fire and kill innocent bystanders. No Muslim outrage.
A country located 2800 miles away from India launches a military operation to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks. Muslims are outraged.
Dead children, dead men, women being raped and killed. Nobody cares. However, if a country 2800 miles away acts in the interest of self-preservation, all hell breaks loose. 
Meanwhile, in another country next to Israel, Muslims are fighting among themselves. If its not Muslims vs non-Muslims, its Shia vs Sunnis. Or Ahmadis vs Sunnis. Or any random group/sect you think of. They always find an excuse to quench their blood-thirst.
Lets stop being politically correct and think for some time. Are these people really ""innocent minorities"" as the Indian news media often makes them out to be? Take any prominent riot or mob-violence in the history of India, Muslims are almost **always** involved. Islam is a violent, fascist cult whose goal is to convert as many people as possible to it. Tolerance is not only absent, it is seen as a weakness that can be taken advantage of. Using derogatory words for individuals that do not belong to their religion is common for Muslims. A sense of superiority and entitlement, however misplaced, is something seen in Indian Muslims all the time. Their holy book declares that world-domination is the ultimate goal of Islam. Convert as many as you can, and kill the rest.
Let me state my opinion loud and clear. I don't care if you call me communal, bigoted, right-winged, BJP supporter or whatever. I **DO NOT** believe that Muslims are a minority in India. I absolutely **DO NOT** believe that they are oppressed, poor, innocent souls that are the victims of the the majority community all the time. I believe that Muslims are the perpetrators of almost all the violence and civil unrest that this country faces. Their arrogance and intolerance is what is wrong with them. In the present times, Islam is the **single biggest** danger that India faces today and must be **STRICTLY DEALT WITH**, no matter what it takes.

Modi Government : lack of talent,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3jgjqo/modi_government_lack_of_talent/,56.0,Politics,1.0,3jgjqo,Whathappenedyaar,"A lot of people have criticised the Narendra Modi government for being light intellectually. They say unlike the UPA the NDA lacks the necessary talent (bureaucrats and technocrats , many of whom have left the government because the government refuses to work with them like Amitabh Kant) and is filling the gap which academics, and technocrats should fill , with under educated individuals . And this shows up in lack lustre implementation of policies.
A prime example of this is the Jan Dhan Yojana which was another Congress policy implemented and taken credit for by this government.
According to the latest statistics 54% of the accounts have no money in them . While that number has come down from 76%. Its more or less found its bottom.
Considering its costs the government 125 rupees per account to maintain these accounts. The cost to the exchequer is actually around 1000 crore. Most banks are in fact not even breaking even.
This is a classic example of the government and how Modi lack the necessary talent to both implement policy and make new ones.
**In fact going forward post implementing ideas which Congress drew up they will have to start implementing policies of their own , and since coming to power I don't see a single original policy come up for discussion which would make me think whether the Government is really capable of delivering its mandate**",2015-09-03 20:14:12

Graham Stuart Staines (1941 â 22 January 1999) was an Australian Christian missionary who, along with his two sons Philip (aged 10) and Timothy (aged 6), was burnt to death by a gang while sleeping in his station wagon at Manoharpur village in Keonjhar district in Odisha, India on 22 January 1999. In 2003, a Bajrang Dal activist, Dara Singh, was convicted of leading the gang that murdered Graham Staines and his sons, and was sentenced to life in prison.
He had been working in Odisha among the tribal poor and lepers since 1965. Some Hindu groups alleged that Staines had forcibly converted or lured many Hindus into Christianity; Staines' widow Gladys denied these allegations. She continued to live in India caring for leprosy patients until she returned to Australia in 2004. In 2005 she was awarded the fourth highest civilian honor in India, Padma Shree, in recognition for her work with leprosy patients in Odisha.

Of course, you can't put anything past anyone these days, but I highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives, away from civilization, locked in mosques around the world, praying, and talking about praying when they're not actually praying, would do anything like that. That is literally the mission of the Tablighi Jamat, they're basically Muslim sanyasis. Seriously, it's a matter of pride for them that they have nothing to do with the ""material world"", as they call it. They're literally oblivious, which exactly why they didn't pay heed to the coronavirus situation. Granted, that was extremely dangerous and wrong, but I still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs, much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses. 
Obviously, there is zero proof of any such occurrence. Aaj Tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds, which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour, while yelling about ""jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot"". Sure, maybe they have been uncooperative because they're stubborn fools, but I doubt the other stuff about them dropping their pants is real lmfao. 
Of course, this is my opinion, based on my knowledge and experiences, and everyone is free to believe what they want, but I'd encourage you to exercise a healthy amount of skepticism while watching news these days. More so when you're sitting with your family, watching channels like Aaj Tak or Zee News (I know boomers love sensationalized news stories). Don't believe any of it until you see absolutely concrete proof. Most people here know this, but these channels are trying to push a narrative (with support from certain people), and they'll go to any lengths to do so. Facts and consequences don't matter to these people, as long as they get more viewers. It's a win-win for them, their overseers get to disseminate propaganda and stay happy with them, while they get TRP. Then they can say things like ""Aaj Tak ne sabko pacchada, no. 1 since the beginning of time"" and rub it in your faces.",2020-04-04 20:22:46

2 : She is travelling at the moment and staying at the hotel.She just called a guy from okc to her hotel room directly and the guy is going to meet her at this time without having met her first. Thirsty ,very thirsty guy.

AAP Theory (more sinister than you think),https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1zvj4v/aap_theory_more_sinister_than_you_think/,50.0,Politics,1.0,1zvj4v,ychromosome,"Here's my theory about AAP. Advance disclaimer: I have absolutely no sources or no proof for any of this. This is purely speculation from my side. Take it as you may.
1. Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement was sponsored and supported with the objective of causing an Arab Spring type revolution in India which would take the incumbent government and existing systems out of play. This was the first step.
2. The next step was for the power vacuum to be filled by Arvind Kejriwal and his yet to be created party.
3. The third step was for AK's disruptive government/party to break-up India in the name of decentralization and mobocratic anti-corruption. Like many leftist revolutionaries, these guys are all set to dismantle all of the existing power structures and systems in India under the excuse of their being corrupt. This is how they plan to weaken and break up India.
4. The fourth step was for any and all types of foreign powers and groups to carve up the weak and broken India as they pleased over the next few years / decades.
Fortunately for us, the first step didn't turn into an Arab Spring-like revolution. Nevertheless, the second step of the plan went ahead and AK floated a party which is trying to take the top spot.
Fortunately for us and unfortunately for them, the top spot didn't become a vacuum, nor did they turn out to be the default choice to fill it. Instead, the default choice at the moment appears to be BJP and Modi. Thus, AK's and AAP's top priority is now to bring down Modi. If they manage to do that, BJP may or may not be able to keep AAP from taking the top spot. If AAP reaches the top spot, steps 3 and 4 above may resume.",2014-03-08 20:20:55
Asexuality... your stand?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4ie84k/asexuality_your_stand/,9.0,Non-Political,5.0,4ie84k,techmighty,"So what's your stand on Asexuality, in general, and not specifically in Indian society/culture?
   1) You completely support it
   2 )You completely oppose it
   3) You are ok with others being in Asexual relationships(so most of Indian marriages after 1 year), but would not encourage your [friends/family/esp. kids] to date both men and women, based on a simple logic that bisexual relationships are obviously confusing and contradictory and that they are 100% responsible for people doubting their own sexuality.
I stand by 3.
You may have strong arguments against me, but if someone in my family cant be a breeder with no sexual tendencies, then this is where I would stand. Like I said, I would be ok with others being Asexual, and will not boycott the person, yet I will maintain my stand. Humans who are capable of breeding, and then dumping their partner to just because they arent sexual?
It hurts people like Ross Geller, who spent years with someone only to get divorced, so that Carol's only goal is to become mombie. come on, there are much more to achieve other than bacche nikalna!

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 
So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.
He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 
Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction.

It was difficult to choose between some very worthy candidates. After holding discussions with the candidates individually, /u/saptarsi and /u/fluttershy_qtest seemed the most suited for the positions currently available. Please welcome them as new mods of /r/India.
/u/saptarsi has been a long term contributor on /r/india and understands how a forum like /r/india should be managed in order to promote healthy discussions and bring-in good content. /u/Fluttershy_qtest, a mod at /r/worldnews, is well-versed with mod duties and is mostly available during IST peak hours, which will help us handle moderation more effectively.
Weâd also like to thank /u/brownboy13 and /u/kabuliwallah for their contributions as mods. They both stepped down from the mod team last week.
Again, weâd like to thank everyone who took the time to nominate themselves and especially those who gave detailed replies over PM. If we need any more help with moderation weâll be sure to get in touch with you guys.

**Revamped Rules**
**CONTENT REMOVAL:** In an effort to make /r/india more welcoming for everyone and promote healthy discussions, we have been actively removing personal-attacks, name-calling, hate-speech and similar degrading comments for the past one year. The results are pretty evident and as a lot of you will agree, this subreddit has improved in terms of atmosphere and hostility. However, these simple rules around being civil, tend to get lost somewhere between in the long wiki and sidebar, so weâll add a concise version of these rules to the sidebar in the coming days, which will act as easily accessible pointers for all participants of /r/india. Hereâs what it will look like in the sidebar -
**NOT ALLOWED:**
* Personal attacks or name-calling against users. 
* Hate speech & Bigotry - denigrating communities on the basis of race, religion, caste, gender, sexual orientation and/or political orientation
* Unmarked NSFW/NSFL/Shock content
* Personal information & Spam
* Witch-hunt and drama threads around /r/india rules/bans/mods/users - weâll make a feedback thread once every 2 months and you are most welcome to discuss, appreciate or critique the rules in that thread. 
Additionally, we have Automoderator removing slurs which are generally used to attack users. As with any automation, there are bound to be false positives and weâll take care to approve these wrongly removed comments ourselves. 
**SELF-POSTS & CONTEXT:** /r/india is not your personal soapbox where you make a self-post with some baiting title and leave the users to squabble about it. All serious self posts, need to have sufficient context added by OP (one liners to bypass rules will not do). Weâll exempt fun and generic question posts from this rule, but again, weâll use our discretion for it. Political & Religious posts will not be exempted under any circumstances.
**UNVERIFIED TWITTER:** Links to unverified twitter accounts of individuals are NOT allowed. We may allow unverified accounts of widely accepted media outlets, like TheHindu, Newslaundry etc, based on our discretion. 
 
**OLD NEWS ARTICLES:** Based on your feedback, any news story older than 3 months needs to mention [OLD] in the title. This is avoid click-baiting and misleading the readers.
**NEW FLAIRS:** We are working on implementing the new flairs you suggested. There are some technical issues we are facing and would like to hear your ideas. We will be making a separate post about it after this thread expires.  
Thank you once again to all community members for participating and sharing their thoughts with us.

Response to all the intolerance deniers in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/45y4bp/response_to_all_the_intolerance_deniers_in_india/,19.0,Politics,0.0,45y4bp,thenriforum,"Ok, I had enough of this intolerance debate, like most of you, but not in the way you think. Let me define the two sides in this debate first. I am on the side of the so called âintellectualsâ, âliberalsâ, or âpseudo secularistsâ, and the âother sideâ that Iâll refer to below is the people who are of the opinion that this intolerance talk is a bunch of politically motivated crap and everyone doing it has a political agenda, ORâ¦(drumbeat).. is an âanti nationalâ! One thing weâll all agree on, I believe is there is a lot of intolerance on the conversation about intolerance
For the intolerance deniers, if you really donât think sentiments have been changing in the past few years, then you definitely are not reading anything online. Just take a look at the comments section (below) of any article that has any reference to Muslims, intolerance, or could be on any other topic but is just authored by a Muslim. The comments are so âcolorfulâ and âabusiveâ against a certain community that there are more âspecial characterâ letters being used than regular characters, and almost universally all the dirty expletives are being uttered by Hindus (or Whites/Christian Majority nations) against Muslims. 
The level that our dear Indians have stooped to, in online conversation, is beyond what the rest of the world has done and the conversations start and end with disgusting âmaa behenâ language against a certain community. Just based on religion, without knowing who the person is, or what their views are. The anonymity that the online world provides is exposing the true mindset of the majority community in India, and in many other nations as well. Letâs focus on India though, as the reasons for Muslim hatred vary a bit based on the country. The majority will say that the Muslim hatred in rooted in them being the source/cause of terrorism, support our neighbouring country, give importance only to their religion, or they are against our country. Seriously? That is very similar to saying that all blacks (say in USA) are criminals and drug dealers, or all Tamils are terrorists (as they sympathized with LTTE), or all Biharis in Mumbai are paanwallas. Judging a whole community because of a few bad elements in it is as horrible a crime as can be. After 9/11, many Americans thought anyone with a brown skin is an Arab and a terrorist. Do we really want to stoop so low in our thinking? Canât we differentiate between innocent women and children being killed in Gujarat (even if they are Muslims) vs. the real extremists (such as ISIS) being killed? Arenât Hindus known to be the inheritors of the Ram Rajya of âdharmaâ and justice, who will never punish an innocent person? A true believer of Dharma will never allow the killing of an innocent person to go unpunished, no matter what religion the person belongs to. 
This is a good Segway to the first talking point of the so-called hypocrisy that the other side accuses the âintellectualsâ of. We only raise a hue and cry when Muslims are affected, but not when Hindus are affected. For example, did the media make a big issue of the Kashmiri Pundits being kicked out of Kashmir? (You can almost see their heads nodding arrogantly on reading this). That is the typical hogwash that they emit to try to convince themselves about how wrong the other side is. The thinking and principles of the âintellectualsâ is crystal clear..we will oppose anybody who harms an innocent person. This means we will strongly oppose animals like ISIS members, the killers of the Bangladeshi Bloggers, 26/11 Terrorists, Godhra train killers, AND the killers of innocent people in the Godhra riots, killers of Sikhs in 1984, killers of an innocent person in Dadri, and killers of an innocent write in Karnataka who spoke about intolerance. 
All these are grave crimes that cannot go unpunished. Justice should see no distinction and take no sides.  We are the ones opposing ALL forms of injustice, whereas the only response you guys have when asked about an innocent minority person being killed is âWhy are not talking about Kashmiri Punditsâ?,  or something of that sort. We are NOT the hypocrites, YOU are! Case CLOSED, and hypocrisy EXPOSED! There is no explanation that you can give to justify that reaction. An innocent person being killed should be condemned. Period. The fact the you guys are trying to avoid or cover up or distract from the topic of innocent killings shows that you actually condone it, and that is a result of the hatred in your mind. There is no other explanation, so stick your response youâre forming in your mind, in your âearâ!
When Aamir Khan highlighted atrocities against Dalits and women in Satyamev Jayate, he was given an award by the NCSC in 2012! The same person when he highlights atrocities against Muslims, is suddenly âanti-nationalâ? People talking about the nationâs capital being the ârape capitalâ of the country are not damaging the reputation of the country, but when Aamir mentions heâs alarmed about some recent kilings the country he is âdestroyingâ the reputation of the country? Amartya Sen, Raghuram Rajan, Vishal Dadlani and numerous other hindus have also spoken out about intolerance, but there are no protests against them and no stones being thrown at their houses and cars! Moreover, it was Kiran Rao who (allegedly) made the comments, but the protests are only against Aamir Khan? That is unquestionable evidence of the hypocrisy of the âother sideâ (many of them BJP supporters), and there is nothing you can say which can explain it away. 
Hinduism used to be associated with the best qualities â tolerance, peace, kindness, non-violence, intellectual pursuits, karma, dharma etc. etc. â and it used to have ideals that many people looked up to and aspired to emulate. I am infuriated that all these qualities are slowly being extinguished by the current mindset in India, and all these so called âIndiansâ are destroying the image of Hinduism due to the depraved, communal, and inhuman mindset they are displaying in this whole debate.  Now, these swarms of âeducatedâ Indians who only spew anger and venom, and label anyone highlighting abhorrent incidents or differing views an âanti nationalâ and  âenemy of the stateâ. 
These âdifferencesâ existed for many years, but what has changed now? I remember ShahRukh Khan made a statement in 2010 about allowing Pakistani cricketers into India and Shivsena created a ruckus and blocked MNIK screenings. But that reaction was the only limited reaction in Mumbai, and most people opposed that action from Shiv Sena. Fast forward to 2015, and a brief mention about intolerance from SRK is enough to throw vile insults, âanti nationalâ barbs, stones at his home and car, and ban his movies! The difference is that people are now emboldened to openly vent and proudly display their hatred and communal feelings in the garb of âpatriotismâ, because the ruling government has made it acceptable and âpatrioticâ to do so. It is the same as Muslim extremists crawling out from the ground in the middle east, after ISIS came up and put forth an ideology that extremists could justify as âpure ISLAMâ (yes, women salves can be justified by ISIS!)
Yes, I am intolerant too, and I donât have any qualms to admitting it! I am intolerant to people who when asked about a murder of an innocent person respond with âwell, why are you not asking about the innocent people who got killed xx years ago?â I am intolerant about the person who when asked about 1000s of innocent Muslim deaths in 2002, gave the answer âWell, why are you not asking me about the 56 deaths in the train?â Well, Mr. PM and supporters, who the eff says the 56 deaths is not a heinous crime in itself? We do see the culprits of that crime being prosecuted though, whereas the response for the 1000s of other innocent deaths is either âwell, if certain people cross their limits then they have to be taught a lessonâ at worst or  âwell, it is tough to control angry mobs, and the other side is to blame for inflaming them in the first placeâ at best!
I am sure that the people on the other side of this debate are grinding their teeth in anger and foaming at the mouth right now, for if there is one thing they cannot âtolerateâ it is somebody telling them they are wrong! I also know that this will not even change one personâs mind on the other side, for the opinions and hatred are so strongly formed in their thick skulls that you cannot penetrate it with a nuke. The only reason why Iâm sending this is to rally the few individuals who are on my side and who are the saving grace of the country. We need to come together and mount a massive david vs goliath campaign against these destroyers of Indian democracy and Hinduism, because we are not going to back down on this war. This is bigger than the battle for independence of the country, and like we shuttled the brits out at that time weâll make sure weâll rid the nation of this poisonous mindset. Looking forward to the next round in this debate..do forward it if you want to respond or want this debate to continue..

As far as the whole ""BJP is antimuslim"" rhetoric, lets face it- it is bullshit.

Another prediction, which I hope does not come true, was that Modiji would lead India to a war by escalating tensions. So now we have no talks, ceasefire violations, soldier deaths on all sides, terror boat and today, 12 fishermen captured by Pak. All as a means to unite country behind him before next elections.

- **Ban Petrol/Diesel Vehicles for a Fossil Fuel free future!** Almost all terrorist activities use petrol or diesel cars and bikes. This is a brilliant anti-terror move! Let's make India the first country to use only renewable energy based transportation.
- **Ban shock-absorbers for remaining vehicles to make Indian roads pothole-free!** If shock-absorbers are not present, citizens would automatically demand timely repair of roads. Thus pothole problem will be completely solved in a matter of months. This is a surgical strike on every pothole in our country!
- **Ban smoke masks or other artificial breathing devices to make pollution-less cities!** Due to over-use of such masks by children, elderly and others, we are not fixing the root of the problem - air! By adopting this initially painful move, we can slowly evolve to have respiratory systems that can breathe in a toxic atmosphere. This can cause inconveniences to some who might not evolve.

"People who oppose beef ban, would you eat a human being ? (more explanation inside, long post)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3q0x25/people_who_oppose_beef_ban_would_you_eat_a_human/,102.0,AskIndia,0.0,3q0x25,oho_oho,"People who say that we should be free to eat whatever we like, let's say that government allows eating meat of humans that are raised like livestock, people whose mental abilities are below an average human, people who have been raised like livestock since the day they were born. This is a purely hypothetical situation and you can argue that this would never happen. But if it did, would you eat human meat that was advertised in such a way that it made you think more about how delicious it would be as opposed to how it was raised or killed for that matter. 
Please remember that I've nothing against people who oppose meat ban. It's just that I normally see argument against beef ban supporters like, if you want to ban eating beef, why not meat and chicken too ? And if you're banning meat, why not ban eating plants too, as they are living beings and they can feel to ? I've no argument against this statement. 
You can say that even if the human I'm talking about is close to an animal, it would still feel the same feelings that we do, albeit crudely. Also, you can say that it would be difficult to watch something that looks so much like a human, to be killed right in front of your eyes in shops that sell fresh meat. 
You might not agree with this, but I think cows and humans or other animals feel the same basic feelings. I personally think that although humans have a really advanced brain, they can do things that animals might never be able to. Also, we can ask questions about ourselves, our existence, we have free will. I'm sorry if I missed any other important things that we humans can do. But I think, at the end it all boils down to eating, sleeping, sex, excretion and other basic processes. Of course this is a really stupid generalization as I am basically summarising the entire heap of human achievements in a mere one line. 
I personally think that we should be free to eat whatever we like, because we basically rule the world. When I say we rule the world, I mean that we are the most dominant race out of all living beings. You can argue that, deadly virus or bacteria would be a good candidate too, so let's say that we are one of the most powerful races of living beings. Even if people argue that eating beef, or meat is morally wrong, what is right and what is wrong is subjective. So, eating beef or meat is a choice of the individual. 
Some world governments have declared some species as protected and you cannot kill them because they are on verge of extinction and they are important part of the food pyramid. Wiping them out of the face of Earth would been disruption in the food chain and other effects on the environment. So, basically you cannot kill some species even if they are pretty dangerous to deal with like, tigers, lions and other carnivore animals. Their numbers are pretty small in size, so they can't do much anyway, although there are exceptions like tigers attacking tribal people living in the area. 
This further reaffirms the fact that we humans can do whatever we want. Since cows, pigs and other livestock are available in abundance, there won't be any environmental impact and we can kill as many as we want. But, what would we do if there was a hypothetical situation where humans that I described before were a part of livestock too ? Would we eat them too ? What would happen if someday the livestock we've been killing since thousands of years turn intelligent and do the same thing to us ? What would be our thoughts when another dominant race comes in and starts killing us for food and we can't do anything about it ? Would our feelings be the same as the thousands of cows, pigs and chickens we kill everyday for food ? Would we feel the same way on the verge of death as those animals do ? A lot of these situations are pretty hypothetical and stupid what-if situations which might never happen. But the purpose of these questions was to know what you think.
I'm very sorry if this question is offensive to you. I had this questions bugging me since quite some time and I wanted to know your opinion or thoughts. If anything I said sounds stupid, please excuse my stupidity. I think I might be biased at some points, so please take what I wrote with a grain of salt. And thank you for reading this wall of text. I personally don't like reading walls of text, but these questions have been bugging me since quite some time and it just turned out into a wall of text.  ",2015-10-25 2:15:11
I think the Pokhran nuclear tests were the biggest foreign policy blunder India ever made. And looks like we are doing it again with Balochistan.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/50q07z/i_think_the_pokhran_nuclear_tests_were_the/,122.0,Politics,64.0,50q07z,mn_g,"This is going to be a long and controversial post. So please read to the end, I promise it will be worth it.
To start off, India is in a shitty situation wrt Pakistan. One of the main reasons is, we are in a position where we cannot use our vast superiority in conventional weapons/military. It is very dangerous and almost impossible to have a limited scope conventional battle between 2 nuclear powers.
It is very easy for it to escalate into a nuclear war.
For people who want a lot more detailed version of this post, take a look at this MIT lecuture on India-Pakistan clusterfuck. Start at 35mins if you want to skip details about nuclear weapons in general
http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-8-004-reducing-the-danger-of-nuclear-weapons-and-proliferation-january-iap-2015/videos/lecture-1-south-asia-under-the-shadow-of-nuclear-weapons/
This is one of the most unbiased sources you will find. It is given by an Indian/ABCD prof Vipin and you will see that it is relatively unbiased. No professor, TV channel in India will have the balls to look at things this objectively.
1971 war was pretty bad on Pakistan and they were not ready to lose a conventional battle to India again. Indira Gandhi tested a nuclear device, which is technically not a bomb, was dubbed as nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes. World bought it to a certain extent except Pakistan, 
where the famous words ""we will eat grass, but we will get nuclear weapons too"". But ours was not a bomb. It was a bulky, almost 2x the size of a car, which could never be mounted on a plane/missile.
Then Narasimha Rao's government was very close to testing the weapon and declaring India as a nuclear state. Till then India was not a official nuclear state so the world was unsure. Thanks to pressure from US, they did not test it.
Enter BJP, they even had it in their manifesto that they will test it. They made it an issue of national pride, almost saying the congress govt was afraid of the 'west'. This issue became a big deal, got politicized and was made a matter of nationalism and the leaders did not really grasp the scale of what they were talking about.
Basically doing anything to win the election.
Then comes the test in 1998 tests. India proudly announced to the world effectively that they were a nuclear state. Nationalism and chest thumping everywhere. 2 weeks later Pakistan did it too. This changed the equation between India and Pakistan forever.
Why?
It is almost like Pakistan was baiting India. Both countries had been working on the weapons since the 1970s test and were waiting for each other to test it. Because the country that tests first will face the international ire, sanctions and second country gets to say ""they did it.we are doing it for self defense""
I am sure Pakistan was hoping India would test it, because once India tests and makes it legitimate that they are a nuclear country, Pakistan can do it too and announce they are a nuclear country too. This erased India's conventional military superiority advantage overnight.
All because some retarded overly nationalistic leaders put it in their manifesto.
What could India have done? It could have developed it, kept the world guessing if it had the weapons. Unofficially all countries knew India had the weapons and yes, China would not have messed with India because even though India say they dont have it, China knows India does. They would not have taken that chance.
How does it help with Pakistan? Because both sides are publicly saying they dont have nuclear weapons, say India wanted to enter pakistan and destroy a few terror camps. India could have used its conventional army and done that. Its like 2 card players hiding their best cards and holding on to it, bluffing that they dont have it while both sides know they do.
India folded first and showed its cards. India could always use its conventional army for limited scale objective missions. Pakistan would be in a position where they cannot use their weapons unless India went all in, trying to invade all the way to Islamabad, then all bets were off.
Now, Pakistan says ""any missile fired from Indian side, we automatically assume that it is a nuclear weapon and will respond with a nuclear weapon.""
Because they are technically right. India is a self certified nuclear state and they cant risk a single missile landing there, wait for it to explode and see if that was 
a nuclear weapon and then respond. So now, even a single missile fired towards paksitan will get a nuclear response from them and so India's hands are tied.
Pakistan knows this and started testing India's patience. Kargil in 2001, Parliament attack in 2002 and several others all the way to Mumbai. It is no coincidence that attacks from Pakistan suddenly increased after 2000. Pakistan must have been laughing loudly when these happened because we could not do squat. Why? we both legitimized our nuclear weapons and our conventional army is tied up. 
If we had maintained we did not, but developed it secretly and kept it, it would have left them guessing. An attack happens on the parliament? retaliate with conventional army. Nuclear? what nuclear? we keep saying ""we dont have nuclear weapons"" and continue with conventional battle. Pakistan cant use their nuclear weapons too.
But in our present case, one Indian army bomber crosses into Pakistan, all they need to do is ""their bomber is here to drop nuclear weapons, we cant wait and see what it is. we retaliate""
BJP's over nationalism basically fucked up the situation.
Same happening all over again with Balochistan. That was our trump card. Entire world knows we are involved there but we kept denying it as no official announced that we are. Pakistan just kept crying that we are and world did not know what to do. Who were we kidding when we built 6 ""embassies"" in afghnistan. Why do we need that many there?
We are second biggest donors for Afghanistan after US. Whole world knows whats happening and they kept quiet and Pakistan was the only one complaining. Then comes Modi announcing it to the world, to make his supporters at home feel like we are actually doing something when the govt is getting humiliated in Kashmir.
What changed now? Not a damn thing in Balochistan, we were involved before, will be involved in the future. The only difference is, now Pakistan has an official statement from our PM to point to, when any terror attack happens related to Balochistan. Pakistan-China economic corridor passes right through, China knew India 
was involved in derailing attempts, now our great PM made it official. China now is openly saying ""India is derailing our economic projects there. Your PM just said it!"" We have effectively legitimized their support of terror in Kashmir because our PM openly said we are supporting inside their country! I just cannot believe what a reckless move that was 
I am scared at what this blind nationalism will lead to. BJP is a different kind of poison.
Thoughts?
edit: highly recommend the attached MIT video. Will change the way you look at India-Pakistan conflict
EDIT: I AM NOT SAYING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DEVELOPED NUKES. ITS  A GREAT THING WE DID. EVEN IF WE HAD NOT ANNOUNCED IT, THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW IT. CHINA WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO CHECK IF WE DID BECAUSE WE HAD ALREADY TESTED IT IN THE 70s.",2016-09-02 12:10:58

While you are trying hard to maintain a distance and get over it, girls don't feel the need to have a coolver period and even try to bhaizone you. I mean c'mon! After rejecting someone, the relationship between two people changes drastically and then they are neither friends nor lovers and I must add the feeling between them is extremely painful which sadly girls don't understand. My hypothesis is that since it is usual for boys to approach girls, they have become used to getting approached and rejecting and its a second nature for them to move on instantly. Nothing wrong with that, as otherwise they will not be able to finish any of their tasks single handedly.",2019-06-13 5:39:17

But going through the forum here:
http://defence.pk/threads/peshawar-massacre-ttp-kills-hundreds-of-school-kids.348882/
all i see is denial and demand for more blood. Some members claim that attackers were not TTPv(Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan, a Sunni Muslim militia) , they were Hindus from India. Others claim that Hindus are supporting TTP. They want missiles fired into Afghanistan, attacks on assumed TTP offices there. They want reciprocal attacks in India. From what i make sense of, they are just digging their own grave deeper. 
Dear Pakistanis,
At least take some time off today and think about the dead children. TTP attackers wore the same uniform as Pak troops in Kargil war. Think about the devil you have created and nurtured in the name of Kashmir and Islam.

[RANT] I'm sick tired of Mr. Modi's development BS talk in foreign land without much needed reforms on the ground.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3tpgs7/rant_im_sick_tired_of_mr_modis_development_bs/,59.0,Politics,36.0,3tpgs7,Responsbile_Indian,"1st of all this not a mindless hatred for BJP govt, if you look at my previous comments I have generally maintained criticism/appreciation based on policies rather than political ideology.
I have this perception that MSM (mainstream media) has generally negative views of current central govt so for past one month, I have stopped following MSM and deactivated my Twitter account. On twitter there seems to be either a civil war b/w liberal/left/RW or lame jokes by stand up comedians.
The only thing I have been reading now is Business Standard which mostly maintains neutral standpoint since majority of the news is just market reports or/and policy framework of govt.
But here too, have been seeing loads of vomits of Modiji in foreign land and I swear to god, I'm getting sick to my stomach. [For instance look at this](http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/modi-promises-reforms-with-speed-and-boldness-115112100641_1.html)
* I dont understand why the fuck is he promising reforms with speed, why the fuck not sit your ass and do whatever the fuck is necessary. By giving a credit line of USD 1 billion, he thinks that he is statesman. Instead he sounds like a paid clown. China can just piss USD 10 billion like that. Why the fuck always compare yourself with China when you don't have much oxygen in your lungs.
* Madarchod, there has been hardly any motherfucking so-called reforms. Instead, budget of social welfare NAREGA has gone up. India has moved just 4 motherfuckin points in WEF' Ease of Doing Bussiness and this 4 point is because of improvement in power generation.
* There are plenty of low-hanging fruits for Mr. Modi which do not require parliament legislation. For starters he can sell sick PSUs like Air India/MTNL/HMT etc among others. But there has been only talks of their sale. Isn't minimum govt means not getting into business. Instead no, this lodu govt is instead regulating the Air fairs. **Marx & Lenin must be rolling in their graves when people call this govt right-wing**. That's the reason I respect left wing more than right wing. At least, left wing has philosophical clarity.
* Tell me who the fuck thinks India is growing ~~fastest~~ 7.5% per annum. If you look at the data, major indicators either shows stagnation or downward spiral. Private investment has actually gone down. Public investment has gone up. Just by changing calculation method, your GDP doesnt start growing overnight.
* Mr Modi has been extremely lucky that he took over when commodity & oil prices have been historically lower. In such a condition, it's quite easier to push difficult reforms but he wasted 19 months like that. **Even infamous UPA2 had balls to let the govt fall for the sake of India-US nuclear deal, this govt seems to have no balls**
* Mr Shourie had advised govt to pass the buck of land-reforms to state govt and instead focus on GST, labor & corporate laws. But Modi picked dumbfuck like Jaitley who acts like a lawyer. Govt could have easily passed GST & labor laws in 1st year itself but dint show any urge and now they have lost the momentum. Opposition has become stronger, now they would have to suck dicks to pass shit.
* Look at the education sector. How the fuck can we grow @10% with an unskilled & uneducated masses. This Irani is out to fuck everyone of us. No vision so far. **Instead filled all important education vacancies with RSS thugs. My problem is not installing RSS sympathisers but rather choosing losers who have no merit. COuld not she have chosen Anupam Kher instead of Gajendra Chauhan**. At least congress  chose Congress sympathisers for such posts who were a bit qualified.
* ** See the irony, Mr Modi talks about iPhones & Android when in reality every 4th girl of his country if bloody illiterate**. Madarchod, Facebook/twitter apni gaand me daal lo when every 4th woman of your country is illiterate.
* **This govt was supposed to be about minimum govt maximum governance but they imposed cess for Swachh Bharat**. Any sane person would have rather rationalized the existing tax regime and make it more transparent. But no, lets put some more tax and fuck formal sector employees in the ass.
There have been some reforms in power, infra & railway sector but that's that. These ministers are competent but they can't achieve much without over-arching reforms.
**I'm sorry for the rant but it hurts to see the daily chutiyaps of political brass when your country is going to shit every passing day. IF India wants to develop and feed its people, there is no right time like this. This opportunity can't be missed. Oil & commodities prices are lower, govt is in majority in Loksabha. It should persuade other parties and pass important reforms. There are more hungry people in india than whole Africa, we badly need progress**.
I'm done you can downvote now.
EDIT:- People sharing me links of govt plan to do awesome things. This is exactly what I'm saying, govt should do reforms and not talk about it only.
TO clarify few things:-
* On Gadkari's some of tall claims. [Data nails Gadkariâs claim on roads built under UPA-2](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Data-nails-Gadkaris-claim-on-roads-built-under-UPA-2/articleshow/47391678.cms).

Now the Challenge:--> Discuss any religious topic with your family member. Ask a lot of why? and Share your outcomes. 
\----------------------------------
Full Story
\----------------------------------
A thought occurred in my mind.
We know Rama as a ""Maryada Purushottam"" and ""Ideal Person"". So What did he do So that we can call him a ideal Person.I searched my mind and only able to figure out some like left kingdom, left his wife as a king etc.
I couldn't find any other thing.
So I went and have a discussion with my Mother. I told her ""what did Rama do? And Why should I follow him? There are a lot of people like Gandhiji, Bhagat Singh etc and these people did this kind of work.That's why someone should follow these people. So What about Rama?""
My mother told me ""Rama Left the kingdom, left his wife as a king and he is a god who took birth as a human for us. So we should workshop him. And don't ask these type of question about religion and to religious people(i.e priest)?"".
 I quietly asked ""Why should not I asked question about religion and to priests?"" Mother told me ""Because they are always right we should do as they told us to.""
I told her ""if I got infected from Corona and A priest say that God chose me for his work. Now spread that virus and do your duty"" So that will be right?
She thought for a second then said ""No, you should ask question.""
So I told her ""Maa, There are a lot of people who think that whatever their religious leader saying is right. They neither ask question nor actually think about that. They just do whatever their religious man is saying. And These people belongs to every religious Hindu, Muslim, Sikh etc.. And These Tablighi Jamaat are also such people""
As Soon as I put up the Muslim reference(and other fact about them) in our discussion She said ""*So Now you have became anti-national also"".*
I was like WTF. **I live in a remote village. On daily basis my mother watch a little news on these shit channels. You can imagine the kind of damage Godi media have done that ""A Mother is calling his son Anti-National"".**
To Godi Media: I will do what ever in my control to stop you. and If any person from Godi Media is reading this ""Shame On you"".
Ok Done.

Oh! whither my India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3nzwl4/oh_whither_my_india/,18.0,Politics,4.0,3nzwl4,UnguidedMissile,"My Indiaâ¦..
A country that till 18 months ago, was blessed with perfect communal harmony, the country that enjoyed an absolute freedom of expression, the country that had not banned a single book, movie or play. 
No one had heard of the word âcasteâ in my India and the word âreligionâ either. There was no hunger, nor there was poverty. All the farmers were billionaires so no one ever committed suicide. It was a wonderful country where people could eat as much beef they wanted, anywhere they wanted. There were no laws banning cow slaughter in any state. No one had heard of words like corruption, murders and rape. 
Communal violence and riots were unheard of. The years 1947 and 1984 skipped India, therefore there were no such things as partition riots and anti-Sikh riots. The year 2002 however did happen in a terrible place called Gujarat, the single stain on the spotless secular fabric of India! Kashmiri Pandits lived in the valley in peace and harmony with their neighbours. The ethnic cleansing of the valley never happened. Serial bomb blasts and terrorist attacks were also terms that did not exist. 
Indians did not know what unhappiness or poverty or suffering meant. If they wanted to experience it, they would go on a conducted tour to Sudan or Palestine!
Such was the paradise that was my India!
Unfortunately, the good run did not last. 
16th May 2014, I still remember that dark day - the day Fascist Patriarchal Hindu Male Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister! 
That was the day India saw poverty, communal violence, law and order issues, farmer suicides, caste discrimination, gender discrimination, murders, rape, tax avoidance, spitting on the roads, litter in the streets, road rage and every other social evil that you can think of, for the very first time!! 
Thanks to this evil guy Modi, communal violence has crossed all limits. Every day millions of people are being massacred in India. At this rate, there will be no voters left to cast their vote in 2019! 
Some eminent historians and liberal thinkers have compared this regime to the Taliban - that social organisation formed by terrorists with no religion. The Taliban however is so hurt with this comparison that it wants Arvind Kejriwal to hold a dharna on its behalf!
We enlightened citizens know that oPM Modi is PERSONALLY responsible for everything from our constipation to clogged toilets at a railway station. I am upset that Modi has NOT issued a statement yet on why there are paan stains on the staircase leading to my building. Everything that is wrong in this country is the PMâs fault. NO ONE else is to be blamed. 
Oh my poor poor India! What have you done to deserve this? I need to find a suitable award to return to protest against this. 
I hope this Modi resigns soon and we liberal intellectuals can return to the perfect Utopian paradise that was India under the great leadership of intellectual icon, Rahul Gandhi!

Many of you will say that this is because porn is banned and suddenly I am losing my shit. That is the tiny percent of it. I am mad because this clear violation of freedom. 
They felt fit so they banned beef, banning of documentary, etc. It's like your entire party is obsessed with pushing there own cultures down our throats. Even I am hindu but I don't care if somebody else eats beef or parties or watches porn. 
How the fuck does it affect me or you? 
If you're argument is that porn encourages rape, so think about this for a second, porn releases sexual tension that otherwise was not possible. In hindi if I tell you it's tharak nikalna. It helps keep the mental state normal. 
Infact by banning porn you have just helped multiply prostitution industry. You have heard of prostitution industry right? The industry because of which many young girls are kidnapped. 
Forget how you think this will improve anything, because lets be honest you haven't even blocked the ones I goto. Just the ones commercially famous. Why did you block liveleak I will never understand. 
Lets look at the main point that you guys have decided to turn this country into your own agenda. If I were to give examples can I say Taliban, Saudi or ISIS? 
They are also too obsessed with keeping there culture close to there hearts and halting progress as much as possible. You certainly are on the right track with this. 
Many are not even realizing how slowly and steadily you are taking away freedoms and before anyone will ever realize there would be nothing left to go back to.

Let us agree on one fact: women devotees of Ayappa have never and still don't try to force their way into the Sabarimala temple. Then who the fuck are the women trying to get in, you say?
Simple. These women are atheists (not that I have anything against them), who are trying to ""exercise their cconstitutional rights"". *What stake can an atheist claim in religion?*

Also, I could not find a direct quote, but not to forget his mention of the 'pushpak vimanas', space travel and inter-species head transplants in ancient Hindu India.
IMHO, he is the PM with the lowest IQ we have had in our ~67 years of independence. The only reason he is the current PM is that most of the rest of our citizens have a somewhat similar IQ.",2015-07-20 7:52:46

The problem with the India's daughter documentary,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2y120e/the_problem_with_the_indias_daughter_documentary/,126.0,Non-Political,26.0,2y120e,MyJones,"I would like to start by the obvious a  reminder for you that rape is not a problem of India, nor is it a feature exclusively of India, our men , or their mindset. We should all know by now even if India accounted for the massive under reporting of rape we would still not even make the top 20 countries for rape per capita. Rape is an epidemic worldwide, it happens in all corners and all forms. 
And yet in western media narrative India is singled out as to make it seem we hold the exclusive rights to rape.
The problem with the Delhi rape was the manner in which it occurred and gruesomeness of it, which of course became free fodder for a western media already foaming at the mouth. But surely we don't believe that this was any worse the case of say Elizabeth Fritzl where the woman was held for over 20 years and raped while being held in a dungeon or  the case John Jamelske a serial rapist and murder . Yet we never saw a documentary or an outcry of rapes in America. Am I  excusing what happened certainly not. But surely it doesn't take a genius to recognise that the topic of rape and has somehow become the raison d'etre of the western media's narrative on India.
A place where men apparently can't control themselves. 
Of course knowing the history of western mainstream media we would know why this happens . 
It simply goes to a little book called Manufacturing consent by Noam Chomsky.
Do we ever hear about epidemic of rape in Australia or Sweden where there is the highest rape per capita in the world? Or did anyone make a documentary about these countries no. We are constantly led to believe western countries especially US and England are somehow places of upotpia whose citizens and governments can do no wrong ; despite Americans being responsible for the biggest genocide in the 21st century we in no way conflate Americans with murder. And yet somehow we a narrative continues that India and Indian men are rapists. 
But this is what they do they tell us Russia is bad and out to take over Ukraine despite the West being responsible for over throwing a sovereign Ukrainian government . They tell us the Chinese are aggressive and convince us we must join to stop this future world menace by surrounding them. Or the latest documentary which paints China as ignorant of the pleas of its people polluting them to their deaths despite every western nation having gone through the same process.
We saw a article in the economist which had no real substance but continously ranted about how India is somehow responsible for all the ills in cricket.
Am I saying India doesn't have problems . No. But this is what they do .
Surely at some point Indians will recognise that this is what the western media do . They manufacture consent. They continously drum through narrative . Narrative which is repeated enough times may actually cause their target audience to believe it to be true. In the 80's it was the USSR is bad and open up your economies and take IMF loans. 
Today its India is a land of rapists.
At some point we are going to have to stop taking the bait, or believe in the belittling that is constantly drummed out by a hemisphere which loses its influence everyday . We are going to have learn how to take a step back and say thanks but no thanks .
**Therefore I look through Reddit India or facebook I see more and more people saying these people do shame upon us that its hard to be an Indian in this moment, I ask you why? What justice do we do ourselves by accepting that the words of two individuals represent the republic and its citizenry? Are we so drummed out at that we have too somehow come to accept this narrative? If that be so shame it would be**",2015-03-06 5:03:05

No wonder people in Bollywood and elites in India have so much love for white people. Whenever a White person from US and British do some work related to India or says something about India and Indian doing some work in US or UK the way Indian English Media covers it says it all.

The agenda of bjp is well known. Their foot soldiers in form of vhp/bajrang dal goons are today emboldened, because they know that after any riots, the administration will look the other way. This means that the next wave of rioting and killing is going to be much more vicious than 2002.

Look at what happened to ""Secularism"". Political groups used this legitimate issue and spun it into a guilt trip against their rivals. It may lead to a few electoral gains in the short run but over the long run, it leads to a massive under-current of resentment and a vicious backlash. Today, ""secularism"" is a joke in the Indian political discourse. ""True"" seculars are now begging people to forget all the propaganda in the name of secularism and revert back to its original nature.
Now these same elements (who ruined secularism) are trying to spin another legitimate issue (women's issues) into a guilt trip.
Just take a look at this article: [Women in India Arenât Safe on Twitter Either: The sexual humiliation of the streets has moved online](https://medium.com/matter/no-safe-places-d59af0c3ba58).
This article is a joke. 
> These days, though, nowhere is protected: some Indian men are determined to use the web to target women whose opinions they hate or fear. And, just like street hoodlums, they employ a mob mentality, work in packs, and deploy sexual language to terrorize and humiliate women.
.
> Itâs clear from their online behavior that these men are largely privileged Hindus, many of whom live outside India and enjoy well-paying jobs. Prominent political journalist Sagarika Ghose, who has 361,000 followers on Twitter, calls them âcommunal techies.â She also coined the now-ubiquitous term âInternet Hinduâ in a reference to their infatuation with the Hindu right wing nationalist ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won an overwhelming majority in the general elections that were held in April. The Hindu far right is famously patriarchal, and blind to the humanity and individuality of women.
.
> Take poet and novelist Meena Kandasamy. She writes about sexuality with a rare frankness, has over 25,000 followers on Twitter, and is a regular target of abuse. Speaking to me from Chennai, she said that the particular vulgarity of the tweets she is subjected to is influenced by the fact that she belongs to a low caste.
.
> âThey want to frighten me off Twitter,â she told me. âThey want me in a subjugated role.â **Top lel**
.
> The fact that a low caste woman could be seen as successful, not just by the standards of her community, but by the intellectual mainstream, is galling to caste-obsessed right-wing Hindu men. **ROTFLing @ her wishful fantasies**
.
> Sagarika Ghose, despite the fact that she has a TV show and a newspaper column where she can publicly call out abusers if she chooses to. âI regularly receive rape threats,â she told me. âIâm regularly called a whore and a slut who sleeps with âCongiâ (Congress) politicians and every day my timeline is filled with abuses like âass licker,â âslave,â and âCongress sepoyâ [foot soldier].â **What did she expect? People will thank her for calling them Nazis and murderers? Lulz**
> Ghose shrugs off the abuse. âTheyâre playing out some perverse patriarchal fantasies of dominating strong women.â
> Though right-wing Hindu men seem to be the majority of abusers on Twitter, just as they are the majority of people on the ground in India, their tweets suggest a profound sense of victimization. They portray themselves as a sort of endangered species whose survival depends on extinguishing, if only verbally, the people who are different from them. **Can't you see the hilariously transparent agenda of the article? Lulz**
> Not all women have suffered the onslaught. Right-wing women are protected from the abuse, earning relative freedom by prodding liberal womenâeven those who donât follow them or even know who they areâin growling packs, attacking them like some children strike animals with sticks and stones. **There you go. Its not about women. Its about these phony left-wing propaganda machines getting as good as they give.**
This is nothing but a bunch of left-wing moonbats engaging in a cringeworthy display of attacking the Indian voters who just handed them a historic electoral spanking. 
This is pure desperation. This is comic relief.
For better or for worse, we no longer live in an era of uni-directional media. The likes of Roy, Ghose, etc can no longer get away by calling people ""Nazis"", ""genocidal maniacs"", and ""murderers"" without getting a few choice abuses returned by the targets of their vicious propaganda.
And when people return their compliments, they go whining about MUH PATRIARCHY, MUH HINDOOO-RIGHT-WING. LOL. Do you see how pathetically hilarious this is?
Also, consider [this reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28msnd/the_sexual_humiliation_of_the_streets_has_moved/) by a well known left winger.
The thread attempts to use this joke of an article to go on a guilt trip about women's issues.  
Don't attempt to spin an electoral defeat into guilt trips, you'll end up making women's issues into a joke. Just like ""secularism"" has become a joke.

Please let's have a respectful debate. Don't be abusive.  
[EDIT] If your answer is just Modi. Don't you think you need serious introspection 
[EDIT] Reason to support BJP ? 
Findings from people's comment
* Most of the people supporting BJP because of Modi and Modi alone. They don't even care if anythings else exist in BJP or not. 
* People choosing BJP because they think BJP is less shittiest of all the parties.
* Transparency does not matter to them. They think Modi is icon of development and no matter how BJP gets money or conduct it's businesses, Modi will do the development because he can do the development. 
 
* Lot of Indians give everyone at least one chance to pull us out of our misery. Right now, Modi's got the best shot at doing something.
*  Some very optimistic and faithfull supporters even said this 
>I am supporting BJP because I am able to trust them even though they are not disclosing their party funding.
Even in an implausible worst case scenario, if their funding comes from immoral businessmen, corrupt foreigners or religious fanatics, I am able to trust how uninfluenced they are regarding the source of money.
Honestly I can see only negative connotation in all the reasons given to chose BJP, that may be because I am disillusioned by parties actions but again I had said it earlier I am unable to trust it and I am still not convinced that why I should vote for BJP. But thank you guys for giving your side of story it may change the judgement of some other disillusioned voter even though it didn.t mine.

[NP] For Guy Virgins: Basic Things No One Told Me About Sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l9gb3/np_for_guy_virgins_basic_things_no_one_told_me/,41.0,Non-Political,38.0,3l9gb3,whoreyfucks,"I lost my virginity later than the average guy. Before I got laid for the first time I had read a fair amount about sex. I took Sex Education classes in school. I read articles on positions and techniques in Maxim and Cosmo. I read sites like www.sexuality.org. I read the Savage Love column every week. I also looked at tons of porn on the internet and through my PlayStation 2's handy DVD player. All in all, I thought even though I had never done it myself, I knew most of what there was to know about sex.
&nbsp;
Then I started having it and I kept discovering all these basic things that had somehow passed me by. In all the stuff I read and watched these things never came up. I never heard anyone talking about them either. I guess they assumed that the audience was already having sex and that knowing these things was a given. And it seems that porn glosses some things over or does not reflect what actual sex is like. I know, I'm as shocked as you are. So here's my list of basic sexual stuff that I only found out about when I came across it myself.
&nbsp;
Hopefully reading this will make life easier for the virgins out there in some way, you know, by lessening that fear of the unknown or whatever. I think the most common theme below is that sex is not as glamorous as it's sometimes made out to be. However, 'not glamorous' isn't the same as 'not enjoyable'. Sex is awesome. If anything, all the little quirks I'll mention below make it more fun.
&nbsp;
**Positions**
&nbsp;
From reading and watching porn I thought positions like missionary, doggy style, woman-on-top, etc. were simple, cut-and-dry things. I soon found out that each one has tons of subtle variations based on things like how you position your legs, the position of her legs, how deep inside her you are in a resting position, the angle you're thrusting in, the position of your upper body, how high or low your hips are on her body, how your bodies fit together, and so on and so on.
&nbsp;
With some variations her vagina will seem like a straight tunnel that you can easily go in-and-out, in-and-out of. With other variations you're mostly inside her, can only thrust a little, and you're more grinding pelvises together.  
For example, if you're in the missionary position:
* If you put your legs together and straight back, you'll get a different feeling then if you had them spread out to your sides and had your knees further up on the bed.
* If she spreads her legs you'll be able to thrust in one way. If she lifts them up and wraps them behind your back, you'll be able to thrust deeper.
* If you rest on your elbows you'll enter her at one angle and be able to thrust in a certain way. If you straighten your arms and rest on your hands you'll thrust at a different angle.
* If the top of your hip bone roughly matches up with hers you'll get a certain angle and depth. If you try to 'ride higher' you'll get a different angle and depth.
* If your upper body is parallel to hers things'll go one way. If you raise your torso up to around 45 degrees things'll be slightly different.
* What works one way with a petite girl may not feel the same with a girl who's closer to your height.
* The idea is you have to play around with these variations in position to find a way that feels good for both of you (or just you if you're selfish).
&nbsp;
**Vaginal lubrication**
You probably know that the vagina secretes a natural lubricant and that women get 'wet'. I knew that basic fact too, but I learned some more things about the process firsthand.
&nbsp;
* It runs out at some point and she'll get dry, and eventually uncomfortable, during sex. Sometimes you have to pull out and apply some lube. At other times you can keep going for a bit and she'll get wet again.
* If the girl gets too wet during sex it can reduce the friction to the point where you don't really feel anything. If she's too dry it doesn't feel that great for you either.
* If enough of it accumulates it has a whitish, mayonnaise look to it. Sometimes you'll finish having sex and when you pull out and look down you'll see a big drop of it running down between her legs.
* If you're going at in the missionary position, it may run out on to the bed and leave a wet spot on the sheets that's a bit white when it dries.
&nbsp;
**Erections**
If you watch porn you may wonder why the guy's erection is sometimes slow to grow. You're thinking that if you were in his shoes you'd be as hard as a rock in a second.
&nbsp;
* Nope, the same thing will happen to you. Once the intial thrill of hooking up with this girl/girls in general wears off, your erection will often start to get soft when your penis isn't being directly stimulated.
* Being drunk, being distracted, and bad technique on the girl's part can contribute to your not getting it up quickly.
* After putting on a condom you may need to jerk yourself off for a second to get it a bit harder before you stick it in her.
* If it's not hard enough you'll have a hard time putting it in. It'll tend to bend or slide out of the way instead of penetrating. However, if it's slightly soft and you manage to get in it, you can often get it harder quickly once you start thrusting.
* If the sex isn't great and/or you're distracted and/or something messed up happens you may start to go soft once you're inside her.
&nbsp;
**Sticking it in**
You've probably heard jokes about this before. Yep, it can be hard to find the hole. Even if you know where you need to go visually, the vaginal entrance can be smaller and tighter than you think so you may not feel exactly where you need to insert the tip of your penis.
&nbsp;
* With missionary it's fairly obvious where you need to put it, but if you're trying to guide it in blind then it can be awkward.
* With doggy style the hole is further up then you'd think.
* When the girl is on top the angle of her vaginal tunnel can give you problems and you can't really see what you're doing. It's best if she guides it in herself.
* Like I said above, if you're a bit soft then you can have trouble putting it in.
* If you fail to get it in properly your dick will slide somewhere else and may feel like it's in for a second or two.
* All this is more difficult if you have a condom on, as it's harder to feel what you're doing.
&nbsp;
**Climaxing**
You may also watch porn and wonder why the guy sometimes has to jerk off for a few minutes before delivering the money shot. You're thinking if you were in that position you'd pop off no problem.
&nbsp;
* Again, the same thing may happen to you. Sometimes you'll be having sex/getting a blowjob/jerking off and you won't be able to cum. If the stimulation isn't effective it can happen. If you put too much pressure on yourself to orgasm on demand it can happen.
* The more common stereotype is that men finish too quickly and that they have to think about stuff like baseball in order to last any real length of time. But not being able to cum happens too. Not all guys are losers who are done in thirty seconds. Finishing too soon definitely happens, but not every single time.
* In many cases you're not just going to cum instantly as soon as you start pounding away, you have to find the speed, angle, depth, etc. that feels good for you. It's not automatic, just like you can't just masturbate in any random way. You have to do what's effective for you.
* On a related note, women don't always want to have marathon sex sessions. Sometimes they'll get tired of the guy stabbing away endlessly, especially if it's not doing anything for them. Sometimes they'll start to get dry and sore. Sometimes they'll have an orgasm or two and think that's enough. Sometimes they'll just be happy with a good twenty minutes of fun sex and not have any need to go for longer.
&nbsp;
**Minor injuries**
* It can be irritating to your skin when your sweaty pubic hair rubs against hers.
* Someone's hair my get accidentally pulled or caught.
* Someone may clumsily fall over as you're changing positions (e.g., when she's getting off you from being on top, when you try to transition from missionary with you kneeling and her laying down to missionary with both of you laying down).
* You may hit your head against the headboard, har har har.
* When you're going at it missionary style you can end up hitting the bottom of your bladder on her pelvic bone. That gets old after ten minutes...
* Your knees and elbows can get sore after a while from rubbing on the bed/floor/etc.
* During doggy style if you slip out and then accidently thrust back into her pelvis. This can hurt the tip of your dick.
* If she's riding you and you slip out she can come down on your dick. Usually it gets bent a little and hurts for a minute. At the worst you can rupture the tissue and take a trip to the hospital.
* You may get scratches, bruises, pulled hair (purposely this time), and bite marks. That's cool.
* You may fall off the bed or hit your elbow against the wall or something else like that. You just gotta laugh when this shit happen.
&nbsp;
**Condoms**
First let me say that you should always wear these things despite what I say below. You know what can happen if you don't. You may have heard guys complain about condoms, saying they kill the mood or whatever. It's true, they are kind of annoying.
&nbsp;
* They kill spontaneity. You can't smoothly progress from foreplay to sex. You have to stop the action to go grab a condom, open it, and then put it on.
* They smell bad.
* They kill sensation, sometimes to the point where you can barely feel your own dick inside the girl. On the plus side, they can allow you to last longer.
* Sometimes when you're inside the girl they'll bunch up in weird ways and feel strange.
* They interrupt the flow of things after sex is over. You have to pull out, take the condom off, and get rid of it.
&nbsp;
**Messiness**
You probably know this already, but overall sex is messier than what you see on t.v. or in porn.
* You're going to get hot and sweaty of course.
* The woman's lubrication is going to dribble all over the place and possibly stain the sheets. Someone is going to get semen on them at some point. Condom wrappers are going to litter the ground. You may kiss passionately and slobber all over each other.
* Someone may let out a fart right in the middle of things.
* Sometimes when you pull out and she changes positions she'll fart out her vagina (queefing).
* If you finger her your fingers may be covered with a lot of her clear lubricant when you pull them out. You may have to wipe them off on your leg or something. Classy.
* If you have sex when she's on her period, well use your imagination.
* If you have anal sex you may get some poo on your dick.
* If you have a good session, when you're done you're going to be sweaty, red faced, tired, and a bit out of it. Your hair will be messed up, gross stray hairs will be stuck to your skin, the girl will have a bit of white lubricant running out of her cootch. You'll have a bit of cum dribbling out of your dick. There will be at least one condom wrapper on the floor, the sheets and pillows will be all over the place, and the bed will have a wet spot on it. If you cuddle afterwards you'll start to stick together and it'll feel gross when you pull apart. It's great.
&nbsp;
**General differences from masturbation and porn**
If I had to give a simplified summary I'd say masturbating is all about the visuals while actual sex is more about physical feelings. Of course masturbation is about the physical feelings too, but if you're anything like me, the visuals drive the experience and provide most of the excitement. When you're using your imagination you keep flipping between different scenarios until you hit on one that does it for you. When you watch porn you probably skip around between different DVD scenes or online clips until you hit on one that turns you on the most.
&nbsp;
With sex some positions give you something to look at, but you're hardly sitting in a chair watching a scene that has been shot from a distance and angle that gives you a good view. If you're doing a girl in the missionary position you're too close to her to see anything. Your eyes are probably closed, or if they're open they may not be focused on anything. You're probably kissing her or you may have your head nuzzled in her neck. Cut off from the visuals you instead concentrate on the tactile sensations; your dick going in and out of her vagina, your bodies pressed together, her hands scratching your back, her breath on your cheek, how hot you are, the sweat forming on the small of your back, your hands grabbing her boobs, kissing, and various little aches, tired spots, and discomforts. And then there are the sounds and smells; body parts slapping together, her breathing and moaning. The smell of latex, sweat, someone's breath, or her vag.
&nbsp;
Of course, sometimes when you're going at it you'll be picturing things in your head to help yourself get off. Like maybe your girlfriend is going down on you and that feels pretty nice, but not quite perfect, so you imagine a porn scene or hot girl you saw the other day to get yourself over the edge.
&nbsp;
Also, when you watch porn you can mistakingly associate the visual act you're witnessing with the sensations you're giving yourself. For example, say you have a thing for titty fucking scenes in porn. And let's say as you're watching, you're masturbating in a fast, intense manner. You know your body so of course it's going to feel good. But actual titty fucking probably doesn't feel like your fast, intense, just-right wanking. The true physical sensations may or may not be your cup of tea. You may find them too slow or soft for your tastes and be disappointed in the real thing. Here's another example: Maybe when you watch porn you really like the reverse cowgirl position (girl on top facing away from the guy). As a third party observer this position gives you something to look at. But when you're actually the guy all you see is the girl's back and, again, the sensations of her riding you aren't the same as the just-right wanking feelings you gave yourself when you were watching two other people doing it.
&nbsp;
**Some more observations about how real sex differs from porn and the movies**
&nbsp;
* Obviously in real life it's a lot more sweaty, clumsy, grunty, and primal than dramatic Hollywood love scenes make it out to be.
* In porn the positions are all about making the sex visable to the camera and to give you a good look at the woman's body. In real life concerns such as being close to each other often take precedence.
* Personally I've never had sex under the sheets. They just get in the way.
* Personally I think having sex with all your clothes on kind of sucks (it's a bit awkward and skin on skin contact feels so much better), but you see it all the time in movies and t.v. shows (e.g., The Sopranos). Of course they've got other, more practical, reasons for portraying it like this.
* What amuses me in movies now is what you could call the 'instant penetration.' You see it all the time if you look for it. A man and woman will be in their underwear, or even fully clothed, in some sexually charged situation. Maybe the woman is sitting on the man's lap (both in their underwear remember), or the man is standing behind the woman. The camera is focused on their faces. Then the guy will make a little movement, the woman will gasp, and then they'll close their eyes and start moaning, the implication being that the man achieved vaginal penetration off-camera. Yeah, not that quick and easy in real life. You've got to move your clothes out of the way, line things up, the guy has to be hard enough, the woman needs to be pretty wet, and often the man has to guide his penis in with his hand. Otherwise it's a much more awkward procedure.

""Indians are smarter than white people"". What the fuckitty fuck? More than a quarter of the people are illiterate. No amount of juggad is going to change that.

Living in squalor and saying that Indians are adaptable is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Playing fucking dodge the rickshaw while walking down the road isn't a testament to our intelligence, it's a sign of how stupid our average Bharatvasi is 
""Indians are more cultured"". FFS, India has more cultures of fucking diseases than culture. Playing music on the street and dancing every other week doesn't make you cultured. Neither do rituals. 
""Indians have a richer history"". So did Egypt. Wouldn't exactly call them prosperous now, would you?
"" India has a larger economy than China. The Indian economy take place through cash in rural areas"". So, most of Indian economy is people trading fucking wheat and selling cow shit?
""India can defeat China or the US in a war. The Indian Military budget isn't accounted for inflation"". You're buying military gear from France and Russia, not fucking potatoes from the market. That'd make sense if India had it's own military industrial complex. 
""Indian food is better than Western food"". Where do I even begin? You can have flavor without drinking spicy water. Just cause you dumped spices in water and boiled it doesn't mean your food is better. I like Indian food. I also like Chinese, and European food. I don't like people shitting on non Indian food.

My 17 year old daughter is flirting with 5 guys right now; and I am worried.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4ajrf2/my_17_year_old_daughter_is_flirting_with_5_guys/,40.0,Non-Political,0.0,4ajrf2,daddy_in_distress,"So, this is the story so far..
I am 54 year old father, living in Mumbai, and earning more than 7 figures a year. Stable job, nice cars and sea facing apartment. Wife is super sweet, all into community work and stuff. Only daughter, who just turned 17.
This post is regarding my daughter. I have just discovered that she is a super flirt (boy, even overtaking me and her mom). As I am typing this, she is right now flirting (some serious shit) with 5 guys, at the same time on Whatsapp, Skype, Line and some other messenger I suppose.
Now, how I found out?
We have installed a hidden CCTV camera in her room (since she was 5 years) and lately, I have found myself listening to the conversations sometimes. The passion and truth with which she enchants, entices these innocent boys is amazing. 
Now, let me tell you.. she has a CC with Rs 5 lakh limit, and we are going to buy her a Micra car next year, when she turns 18. Yes, the guys she is flirting with are rich brats, and money is not the issue here. It seems she loves to flirt, and then dispose them like tissue papers.
I am worried that she may land up in trouble, in case a psycho type of guy falls in 'real' love with her. She is good in studies, and we were planning to send her to Oxford or something, but now, I am real worried.
So, parents of r/India.. how will you handle this situation? Should I talk to her? Talk to the boys? (one of them recently gifted her a painting he painted, and it was superb. She just burnt it yesterday! I mean, is this a disease or something?)
Edit 1: I know the feeling when a girl rejects you, especially when you are 18 years. Its harder than the slap. Hence, I am worried that her flirting nature may land her in trouble. Sooner or later.
Edit 2: I am not a creepy old daddy, who is invading her privacy. I am a concerned dad, and want the best for my child.",2016-03-16 8:04:25

Tanzanian girl's incident in Bangalore is just Mob violence. Nothing to do with sexual/racial assault.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/449xpe/tanzanian_girls_incident_in_bangalore_is_just_mob/,21.0,Non-Political,3.0,449xpe,manjuhere,"The accident which occured on January 31st is misreported by national media as a case of racial abuse. Home Minister Dr. G Parameshwarappa has given much importance to the fact that death of the innocent local is outweighed by the shame caused due to false reports on the foreign student.
**This is what happened on that day** -
Mohammad ahmed Ismal, a sudanese, was driving a fiat car under the influence of alchohol. He rammed his vehicle into K. Sanavulla and his wife Shabana Taj causing shabana Taj to die on the spot. The locals chased the car which was fleeing the scene. His car was stopped and when he tried to run, he was beaten by few people. When this was happening, a Wagon-R with three of his friends entered and fought the people, took ahmed with him and fled. Anguished by this, they torched ahmed's car. Not only this, they stopped the Wagon-R at Saptagiri Hospital on Hesaraghatta Road. At this time, the following were in the car - Lina Martina, Saloom and Jamal Ibrahim along with Ahmad who was involved in the earlier accident.
**It is true that her clothes were torn**
After they were stopped the 4 tried to fight the locals and this further angered them and beat all of them including the girl. It was seen that there were more than 50 involved with the mob. Lina's clothes were torn in the scuffle. Police who arrived on the scene took ahmed into custody. But, it has to be known that nowhere in all of this was lina sexually assaulted or paraded nakedly. A local resident, prameela, has further said, if at all there was a naked parade they would've done it to ahmed who ran people over, but there was no reason to parade Lina.

**Some observations** - 
* sudden visit by the DGP for this accident but not for any of the local rapes such as the ones in madawala, cubbon park, or the school child's rape. Doesn't local sexual assaults not worthy of this much attention?
* No one is bothered about the dead victim who had nothing to do with this. She hasn't even received any condolences from any official involved. (think what would've happened if BJP was in power here)
**Answers needed by the home ministry for the following** -
* Does the ministry doesn't know about the other illegal  activities of African students?
* Isn't the local news report not according to your requirement?
* Haven't you noticed the attack by these students on the police
With the culprit standing right in front of you and in fact beating you, I'm sure anywhere in the world would there be a mob formed. No need to bring in the circus of racial or sexual assault into this. This is just case of Mob violence and has to be treated the same.",2016-02-05 21:44:55
I'd vote for BJP in 2019,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8c7p7e/id_vote_for_bjp_in_2019/,45.0,Politics,0.0,8c7p7e,redditsudo,"I understand that it is unpopular opinion hence would get downvoted.
I would still vote for modi & BJP.  Despite of being disappointed with him and his team on multiple occasions, I believe BJP is still better of the devils. 
I'm impressed with his vision and the work he's have done so far on nation's infrastructure ( especially roads and railways ). 
I'm also impressed by his efforts towards changing our traditional Indian way of living (e.g. spreading awareness about cleanliness , promoting accountability and transparency in govt departments, Psu etc).
When I voted for him in 2014 I knew that issues he is targeting won't go away magically in few years. Practices like corruption, spreading filth and pollution, zero sense of personal and professional accountability are deep rooted in our society. No modi, gandhi or anyone else can fix these issues in a term.
On rape , I see it is an unfortunate endemic majorly due to our traditionally patriarchal yet repressed society. I understand  that with more females getting aware of their rights and with support of law such incidents will surely go down in numbers. This is why , though  I am deeply embarrassed and disappointed by how Kathua and UP incidents were handled by BJP, I refuse to see them as a report card of Modi government.
To sum it , I'd give another term to Modi. Despite of many flaws , he has the better vision  for our country going forward.
P.S : I have had many discussions with pro and anti-modi friends on the matter. For most of the issues I believe that Congress wouldn't be able to handle them any better. At the end of the day, it is the intent and ability or the leadership which matters the most in a country of 1.35 billion because whatever you do it is really hard to execute anything perfectly right when you've that huge of a democratic population.",2018-04-15 3:29:56

Most people from Western countries *do* see us as extremely poor, of low intelligence. We definitely do not get the same respect in international circles as, lets say, the chinese.
Yes, westerners do come to India, but not because its a beautiful place, as they claim. They come here to marvel at the poverty(which their ancestors caused), the cows in the street, the bizzare religious practice, the stray dogs, the open sewers. They take pictures, then share it on facebook with captions like-
>""I'm appalled by the poverty. Can't we do *anything* to make it better? :(""[136 likes] 
OR
>""Wow Indian men are so creepy OMG!!"" [287 likes]
Its time we stop worshipping everything western, which includes white people. In the video you can see how the man in the beginning tries to befriend her and she and her buddy quickly leave. The whites do not even consider us worth speaking to, then why do are we so eager and over-friendly towards them? I know I am gonna sound like a Kulcha warrior but there really are good things in the Indian culture which we **must** be proud of.
Indians really need to get over their inferiority complex and develop more self respect, if they want things to change.

[R]Why Owaisi is now relevant to me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dvbpn6/rwhy_owaisi_is_now_relevant_to_me/,30.0,Politics,1.0,dvbpn6,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: Because there is no alternative.
A few days before the results of the 2015 Delhi elections came out, a Hindu lady I was speaking to about the ongoing Ghar Wapsi controversies, remarked that Owaisi made a lot of sense when he retorted that since Islam states that every one is born a Muslim, hindu's that convert to Islam would actually qualify for 'Ghar Wapasi'. 
I was in the middle of Atheist enlightenment phase of my life and I scoffed at her. Owaisi was just one more religious rabble rouser, I said. She reiterated: It makes sense within the religious context, because both sides aim to use a religion argument. I agreed to that while still chuckling at what I saw as a non-meritorious argument.
When the Babri Masjid verdict came out on Saturday, my first reaction was to google what Muslim leaders thought of the verdict. It had never bothered me before that there was none I found remotely interesting or even appealing, but it did now. I sadly googled the relevant keywords followed by Owaisi and refresh the page a few times hoping something would come up.
It was as if I was in the Chappelle skit, mockingly calling for Ja Rule to make sense of the disaster that was hurricane Katrina(?) - except that it was in total earnestness. Such is the state of my community that we have so few representatives - some of which have happily sold themselves to the saffron. 
I've since accepted that for even if only for the current period of time, he is the one Muslim politician that I look at as a leader. 
I imagine so many hindus must gravitate towards Modi with a similar distaste of the available hindu leaders, but if in a country with a billion people of your community, a community that has representation across financial and political spectrum and the best man you find to look upto as a leader is a fella previously accused of genocide - let off only because he destroyed the evidence, I'd say that your reasons for looking upto him are suspect. 
So here I am. A decidedly non practicing Muslim that now follows Owaisi's political career with quite some interest. I might even vote for him given the chance. Either way, i'm rooting for him. 
I understand that this post will attract a lot of negative attention, so I've marked it [R]. I'm not here to fight, but if thats how you see things, So be it.",2019-11-13 5:15:26

It provides them with zero balance accounts, a debit card, accidental and life insurance, and enables direct benefits transfer to their bank account.
[Per this article from Firstpost](http://www.firstpost.com/business/jan-dhan-scores-drop-zero-balance-accounts-lpg-subsidies-flow-2076995.html) (with data sourced from the scheme's website):
>According to the latest figures available from the PMJDY website, some **125.5 million bank accounts have been opened** as on 31 January. Of these, **84.5 million are zero balance accounts**.
>On 31 January, the **zero-balance accounts were down to 67 percent of the total, down four percent from the 71 percent which had no cash in them just 10 days before** that. 
>It is estimated that **nearly eight million fresh accounts have become operative with some cash balances in them during this 10-day period.**
>**Of the 15-and-odd crore LPG users, nearly 9.75 crore have signed up for direct benefits transfer**, which is a healthy 66 percent of the total.
>At last count, **Jan Dhan accounts had Rs 10,500 crore of balances, which too is growing robustly. Ten days ago, the balance was Rs 9,218 crore â a rise of 14 percent.**
>According to a review of the DBT scheme on 31 January by the Prime Minister, data from 54 districts where the scheme was rolled out initially show that **âgrowth of subsidised LPG has reduced significantly, accompanied by a corresponding increase in the sale of commercial LPG.** This indicates that the scheme will enable substantive savings in subsidy which can then be deployed for other productive purposes, without reducing any entitlements of existing consumers.â
Now let us look at [former IRS officer Kejriwal's take on the scheme](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/arvind-kejriwal-ridicules-modis-jan-dhan-yojna-says-no-money-in-peoples-account/):
>AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal today ridiculed âJan Dhan Yojnaâ **claiming lakhs of accounts opened under Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs pet scheme have âno moneyâ and people will get insurance benefits under it only after death**.
>âI heard the Prime Minister talking about opening bank accounts of lakhs of people (under Jan Dhan Yojna (JDY)) **but then where is the money?** He now said that they will give insurance of Rs one lakh, which a person will get after he dies,â he said while addressing a rally.
Of all the schemes, actions, and statements of the government, he chooses to ridicule the one scheme that could free the most marginalised sections of society from the clutches of moneylenders, ensure government welfare reaches them instead of being siphoned off, and provides them with accident and life insurance.

In particular, saturated fat does not cause cardiovascular disease.  This is something you see repeated very often on the western internet.  
The cause of cholesterol plaques is subclinical hypothyroidism; thyroid hormones metabolize cholesterol into steroid hormones.  The cause of the hypothyroidism is [the ubiquity of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) in the modern diet](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3gm4nnaudnE/TlGK3y1X0uI/AAAAAAAAA0U/YPMc-DJeMKQ/s1600/LA+in+human+fat+2011.jpg), which directly inhibit oxidative metabolism, and encourage inefficient glycolysis.  
Several years ago, I began taking omega 3 pills, and a few months afterward I started getting hair loss, as well as liver spots forming on my hairline.  I also became very light sensitive, and needed sunglasses everywhere.  I chanced upon the following article:  
http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/fishoil.shtml
It addressed both the liver spots (lipofuscin) and the light sensitization problems I'd been having, so I decided that the author knew something about omega 3s that most others did not.  
I started reading the rest of Peat's work, and would occasionally give one of his guidelines a try, and I would only see drastic improvement every time I did.  **I highly recommend reading and understanding the articles, and experimenting to see what changes work best for you.**  
**Problems with the Indian diet:**  
- High in PUFA oils (antimetabolic)
- High in legumes and other fermentable fibrous vegetables (promote bacterial growth, which produces endotoxin, which elevates estrogen)
- Vegetarian (missing key nutrients like zinc, selenium, B vitamins, adequate protein, gelatin)
**Things that have personally helped a lot:**
- Ceasing consumption of all fermentable fibers.  Basically, I don't eat anything that gives me any amount of gas.  The only vegetables I eat are bamboo shoots and raw carrots.  I eat mushrooms as well.  
- Vitamin K2.  This vitamin is needed for proper calcium deposition.  When I took it, my jaw got wider, my hair grew back, my facial hair got softer, and my anxiety disappeared.  Highly recommend.  
- Taking a big shit every day.  Your fecal matter contains toxins excreted through the bile, as well as toxins produced by enteric bacteria.  The faster you can get feces out of your large intestine, the better.  
- Coffee helps a lot with taking big shits very regularly, and is healthful otherwise.  
- Raw carrots are very good at relieving anxiety, because they are antibacterial, and thus indirectly anti-estrogenic.  Also a good source of fiber which cannot be fermented (because it is antibacterial)
- Gelatinous soups/broths, made from pig feet, chicken feet, lamb bones, etc.  
- Avoiding all PUFA.  This means avoiding ALL oils except for coconut oil, palm oil, and olive oil.  Almost 100% of restaurant food and street food is cooked in PUFA oil, so functionally this means a lot of eating at home.  This also means avoiding foods that contain these oils as major constituents (most nuts, avocados, etc.: check if you're unsure)
**What I might eat and do in a day:**
- Coffee in the morning, with sugar and cream
- Defecate
- Eggs and orange juice for breakfast (protein should be eaten with sugar)
- Rasmalai (ricotta cheese/milk/saffron/cardamom with plenty of sugar)
- 1 mg Vitamin K2, 1000 IU Vitamin D, depending on when I last took these, and how I feel at the moment.  I don't supplement daily, and I depend on butter for Vitamin A.  
- Ripe bananas
- Steak cooked in butter, with rosemary/thyme/white wine",2016-05-20 1:28:34
I am fed up of India.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4ahuk9/i_am_fed_up_of_india/,25.0,Non-Political,4.0,4ahuk9,SquoniX,"Hello there. I hope that the moderators here do not remove this topic, thread, I don't really know what it is called. I hardly post here and I usually just lurk on this subreddit. I am really bad at typing these paragraphs but I will give it a go. 
For the past few months, I have been thinking about this a lot. India has been a very terrible experience for me. I live in Chandigarh which is considered to be one of the most developed cities in our country which is a joke, this city is terrible when compared to the cities in the western countries. The rest of India is way worse, when a person who lives in one of the most ""developed"" cities of a country says that the city is very bad due to the infrastructure available then that's a real shame for the government. There's not a single thing I like about this country (except for the food, I love it) at all, I read the news daily in hopes of reading something which shows that our country is finally developing but no, all I see is news that depresses the hell out of me. The worst thing is that this news doesn't even show the full picture, many things still happen and we don't even know about them at all. Fine, every country has their secrets, so does India. No matter where I go, all I see is filth and terrible infrastructure. I cringe whenever my relatives and friends say ""Hey, look, a new house is being constructed! Development!"" I am not sure if this happens with everybody else. I am not an expert at this but if a house is being built in a place with the worst infrastructure possible, that doesn't mean development. Instead, you're making the situation worse because it would have to be destroyed for constructing something (in case that happens which is impossible). India's government is one of the most inefficient governments I have ever seen, getting work done here is a blessing. I see people posting on this subreddit thinking their opinions actually matter (I know whatever I am saying is an opinion too but I wanted to let it all out), people sending e-mails to TRAI, etc. thinking there will be a change. Even if there's a change, will it make our country any better to be honest? Most redditors here think that they're different from the rest of the country, let me tell you, it's the contrary. All I see is stupid arguments about governments, Modi, Arvind Kejrival, etc. which doesn't help us in anyway. You are literally spending an hour arguing with a person you will never meet in real life. Even if you do win the argument, will it really make any difference? 
My blood boils whenever I see a poor person on the streets because I am unable to help him/her, there are millions of these people. Hell, even we are poor when compared to the people in the western countries. I look at China and see how much they have developed and look at where India is, it's a huge shame for the government. I always notice false hope in the news, people keep living in India thinking that the country will change in a good way, no, it won't. At least not in a couple of decades (I am being extremely optimist here), there would have to be a huge change in the way how the government works to actually achieve any important infrastructural development. I don't really understand why people say that India is diverse and then say it is a good thing. Yes, people from different religions living in a country is a nice thing but do you see what's happening in India? Bloodshed, I would rather live a country with just one religion than a country with 5-6 religions, it only leads to conflicts.
The education system in India is an absolute joke, all I see is students cheating recklessly to score marks and even if they do, they don't succeed in their lives. It's all about the theory, many of my relatives didn't know how to do a job because they just used to cram books. The worst thing I have seen is that whenever we refer to India (before 1947), we forget about Pakistan and Bangladesh. They were also a part of the independence struggle but nowadays, I even see the educated folks insulting them. Just because they're now in a different country? I still consider them Indian, I go to various sites and I see people mocking Pakistan. Many of my relatives are still in Pakistan and I am from Pakistan myself (I am a Sikh). It just feels really bad when I see everybody insulting the people of our own country, the ones of the same origin as us. 
This may sound a  bit far-fetched but Pakistan and India are the same for me, not because of the culture or anything but because of the violence. It doesn't matter how people die, whether they die in terrorist attacks or andolans (protests), people are still dying. My great-grandmother used to say that India will once be as developed as the western countries. Well, I will have to say that she would have been extremely disappointed if she was still alive. I often travel to cities like Amritsar, Jalandhar, etc. and I see that many of the buildings are there since the time of independence, they're still in the same condition. India is changing, you are correct about that but in a bad way (infrastructure-wise at the very least). Okay, let's say that I should forget about the infrastructure, we still need to improve a lot when it comes to our own homes. The internet speed is terrible, the power-cuts and brownouts are terrible, the water is terrible, there's nothing good to point out. If India really wants to change then we will have to destroy a lot of buildings, etc. and start from scratch, all of these houses which are being built feel temporary to me because they don't constitute development at all. The road in front of my house is a 2-lane road, whenever people come to our house, they are shocked to see such a wide road. This thing alone makes me very sad because people in the western countries are used to having a 4-lane road (or more) in front of their houses.
This world isn't fair at all, what did I do to deserve to be born in such a country? I know I am offending everybody but this is the truth. We are all helpless, there's nothing we can do. People keep chanting ""Swacch Bharat!"" but it doesn't mean anything because picking up a few packets of Kurkure, Lays chips, etc. which are lying on a really poorly built road won't help much.
As far as I can tell, India will stay the same, even if it does change, it will take a lot of time and I'd rather not spend that time in this country. I am going abroad as quickly as I can but I don't think I can because my parents don't want to leave India. I am sorry if I offended any of you guys with this but I always see people complaining about something here, thinking that there can be a change. Sadly, there won't be a change. India is totally fucked. It's going to implode any time, in fact, it already is (thanks to all of these stupid riots, protests, etc.). India's too far gone. 
If I were you, I would have left the country long ago. I want to love my country and respect it but I can't respect a country where 99.99% of the population is still living in shitty conditions. 
I hope the best for India.
Thanks for reading.",2016-03-15 23:52:50

Reading through the comments on the Empires of India GIF thread, I think a lot of readers are overlooking that the modern-day borders of India were an invention of the British Empire. For example, many of the Continental European empires included Sri Lanka in their Indias but excluded the northern extemities (because the Europeans arrived from the Indian Ocean).
It's wrong to equate British India, which includes many areas that ought to be classified as Middle Eastern and East Asian, with the cultural concept of India, which includes much of Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka and Maldives. British India included many areas that should be classified as East Asia or Middle Eastern.",2018-11-13 9:40:01

"[R] Why are so many Indians, especially those living in Western nations - so caught up with their Indian identity and pride for the same ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4dyes5/r_why_are_so_many_indians_especially_those_living/,35.0,[R]eddiquette,0.0,4dyes5,PHC_observer204,"I am a firm believer in the view that ethnic and religious nationalism is the starting point in many a conflict in the world. I have seen what happens in the muslim world, in the middle ages with christianity and now I am seeing it happen in India.
Identity based pride and ethno-religious nationalism are the bane of modern society.
What is even more baffling to me is people who left India for greener pastures who still cling on to their sense of identity. Leaving aside the handful of those who are selfish dollar-chasing individuals going their only for the money, surely the secular humanist values of the West and the state of their society itself is an attraction ? Or am I mistaken ?
So my question is thus : In India many components of what makes up society, culture, religion, politics and the very system have just rotted away. When the roots themselves are in this sorry state, why try to cling on to them so desperately ?
Should you not want to move away from the homeland and try to adjust with the society that you now live in ?
Lot of NRI fans of Modi and BJP I find very surprising. BJP is a right leaning party, and that means you are proud of your heritage and want to keep the social order intact. Given that there are so many problems in India how on earth can people who moved out of the country hold on to such views ?
To give a few examples to clarify what i mean - so many problems in India : corruption, bad politicians, dirty filthy public places, spitting on the road, rape, casteism, caste murder, hatred towards women. So many problems with religion also - muslims in India are v.v.backward, hindus are also backward in different ways. Same can be said of other religions too. Maybe that is at the root of why India is in such a mess.
So if you are a conservative, must you not be either :
a) in a state of denial about the problems of India or
b) proud of India good along with bad

Conservatives want to keep the same social order and not change it - so that means they are happy with what currently is in place in India.


I have less sympathy for Indian conservatives because unlike American conservatives they have much less to be proud of. Americans have built one of the greatest nations on earth, and have contributed much to humanity in the realm of sciences and technology. India has contributed some stuffs in the ancient era, but now ? it is just quagmire of casteism, corruption, inequality, poverty and misogyny. How can you be proud of that ?


If you want to hold on to your roots with such vigor how do you resolve this dillemma ? How can you condone the numerous issues in your homeland, and then say that you are proud ? I do not understand.

On this big Indian subreddit (/r/india) I can see people routinely criticizing their homeland, and pride is often talked down. But here the NRI population seems all too happy to be proud about India, why is that ?

If you are not aware there are other subreddits that have India pride sentiments but they are mostly rejects and extremists. On twitter there is now an all out war between those who are proud of india and those who distance themselves from all this and are open to discussing the problems India faces. There is a subreddit for NRIs called ABCDesi but they too are averse to even discussing this topic.

TLDR: Identity politics is what leads to vote banks, and taken to extreme fascistic nationalism. Why do so many Indians both in India and without still hold on to this way of thinking ?

TLDR2: Why do Indians living outside India love the BJP brand of politics, and Modi, to this level ?",2016-04-09 10:35:18

1. Of course the views shown in documentary which reflect the thought process of a major section of the society, not limited to any religion. It really is an ""Indian"" problem. Not Hindu, Not Muslim, Not Christian, Not any other religion but it is specifically a fallacy of Indian mind and a perverted definition of ""Indian Culture"" in the mind of the people.

2. The whole new generation of the youngsters on the social media, the impatient Gen Y of the country who think that they have a progressive world view but lack the most basic quality of progressive thinking, the thirst of fact finding. The generation is too quick to build opinions without doing some fact check at all.

What I want to discuss here is the point two.

Where are we headed? In what direction are we taking the next generation?

All the hoopla around the documentary ban was marketed by irresponsible media houses as government's feeble attempt to save its face.

Was the documentary worth broadcast and put in public domain? Yes, definitely yes.

Was the ban on the documentary imposed for the reason as propagated by media houses and widely spread on social media by our progressive next generation? No, definitely no.

The documentary ban was not because of the content. No matter which politician said what on what television channel about it is secondary, but what was the official stance of the government behind the broadcast ban? What did my country's Home Minister have to say about it? What did the ""democratically elected government""have to say about the reason for the ban?

The official stance of the government can be read here: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=116442

Now I want to simply state that on one hand, we cry out loud about creating stricter laws and better enforcement to fight the evil of rape prevalent in our society but do we have the decency to respect our existing laws? Did we respect the term and conditions which were laid down by the OUR Home Ministry and OUR Jail Administration to a FOREIGN NATIONAL? Did we respect the sanctity of the rules created by our constitution? The answer in its entirety is a big NO.

We abused and mocked our government for banning the documentary without trying to know the reason behind it. We shielded a foreign national who worked around the rules and regulations created under the limitations of the constitution of India to protect the sovereignty of our nation. We valued words of a person with god knows what agenda above the words of our government.

I really feel sorry to say that I am an Indian today, not because of what documentary had shown -- most of us already knew about how society thinks as most of us know at least 20 people who carry the same stance as the people who are being shown in the documentary in our social circles. I am sorry because how gullible we are and how we made a nobody overnight famous and made ourselves cash cow of the same imperialists, who robbed and looted and sucked the life out of country for 200 years.

Please grow up. Stop seeing everything as black & white. Use your rationale and don't believe everything the media tells you. We have glorified a stooge who had no value for our sovereignty. We glorified a channel which had no value for our laws and our constitution. We have mocked our own government which was trying to uphold the sovereignty and sanctity of our laws and constitution.

The problem with current CAA protests - from a right wingers perspective,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f96yyo/the_problem_with_current_caa_protests_from_a/,133.0,CAA-NRC,10.0,f96yyo,jient321,"Note: The post is based on the fundamental premise that India needs to meet these objectives,

a. Secure borders and eliminate any illegal immigration 

b. Deport any illegal immigrants 

If you do not agree to these points, viz. you strongly believe in open borders, we cant have any meaningful discussion - and just agree to disagree. 

Post: The current problems with the CAA protests as I perceive them,

1. Blanket refusal stating 'kagaz nahi dikhayenge' - this is not a great stratgey. Rather, there should be solid proposals from them on how to meet the objectives stated above. If NPR and CAA are unacceptable, what should be alternate methods to achieve these objectives? 

2. Citizenship extension to all illegal immigrants except muslims - this obviously is the crux of the matter, because this aspect clearly discriminates between ilegal immigrants based on their religion. The question then becomes, are anti CAA protestors, protesting on the behalf of Hazaras, Ahmadis and Rohingyas? If so, India already has a system in place to naturalize persecuted minorities so I dont understand why this is such a contentious issue. 

As I see it, albeit with all my biases, the protests  are a boiling over of the suppressed anger against 370, Babri, triple talaq and the soon to be uniform civil code. Also center/left leadership are inciting fear of minority deportation, for political gains. 

Tl;dr - rather than seemingly directionless and rigid protests, anti CAA movement should come up with alternate(s) on a better way to achieve anti--illegal immigration objectives.

*** 

Seeing that the thread has crossed a 100 comments, now is as good a time as any to summarize things and give a final perspective from my pov,

1. While there was a great deal of participation and discussion, it mostly centered around why the CAA+NRC must be repealed as a whole, without any real, better alternative that could meet the objectives 

2. It was clear that there is a great deal of fear and anger over the suspicion that legal muslim citizens will be deported enmasse, but as to what evidence this sentiment is based on was quite unclear 

3. There were also multiple occasions when participants wanted to challenge the premise of stricter immigration laws and whether they are even a truly pressing issue - to this all I want to say on this point is that while there are economic arguments on both sides, this is also an emotive issue for RW folks like me, it is not necessary that it make a strong economic case (which I strongly feel it does). Whether you choose to agree or disagree, it is important that we understand each other on this, personal attacks online or now as we are seeing in the real world, will only dilute and belittle the anti CAA stance. 

If nothing else, this thread helped me better empathize with those of the opposing view, at least their fears and motivations. 

Thanks for your participation.",2020-02-25 21:31:55

""Why should we invest in better training facilities and spend money on gymnastics, when Dipa Karmakar managed to win a medal at the Olympics with what she has?""

Instead, I am glad she finished fourth. It is the perfect place to show how talented and hard working Indian athletes are, to come so far when at such a huge disadvantage compared to countries like the US, China, and Russia, but it is also the perfect place to hopefully convince the government to invest more in sports other than cricket. 

This can be the wakeup call for India to think ""Wait.. maybe we can actually become a respected and competitive team in ALL sports, not just cricket, if only we provide better opportunities for those who are interested."" 

Maybe if we work towards this for the next four years, then at the next Olympics we can see Dipa take home gold, and maybe even see other athletes take home gold in more events like swimming and track and field.

Kabir Singh - Sadist Horny Sexist Objectifying Women,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4r90x/kabir_singh_sadist_horny_sexist_objectifying_women/,17.0,Non-Political,5.0,c4r90x,JitHu1306,"## To all the Randians ranting about Kabir Singh,
I don't understand why Kabir Singh is being judged by Randians!. 
Firstly, to those prying about the story killing the concept of consent and romance, I guess you have been so brainwashed by Bollywood movies and soap opera where the male protagonist ALWAYS TAKES CONSENT before kissing her and DOESN'T SING a song ABOUT HER PHYSICAL BEAUTY, EMBARRASSING HER IN PUBLIC, that you judge a raw and wild portrayal of a character.
Is Kabir Singh HORNY and OBJECTIFIES WOMEN? He never stalked a women, never commented on a women, no booing, no cat calling even before meeting his first and last love Preeti. No whistling the lady and shouting her name. no getting into fights just to show his masculinity and impress her. Who are you to judge how two people in a relationship behave with each other.

Another radian was very upset that movie had a scene where the hero tries to cut a women's dress with knife. According to this person KABIR SINGH is SADIST< RAPIST. I guess maybe the Redditor failed to realise that women(married) apparently wanted to sleep with the doctor who treated her husband. And NO the hero doesn't drag her into it. Maybe the Redditor doesn't get wild intercourse or foreplay. She brings UP and Bihar and I am really glad she brought up that. I wonder if she has watched Bhojpori movies. People like these are only worthy of the stereotype love stories where the hero is a scum who lives on the street, never been to college, shames the heroine by singing a song on her fairness, dances and forces her to dance or wait as soon as he sings she joins him to dance being impressed, and fights with the goons.

Bottom line I think it's RIDICULOUSLY STUPID AND DUMB to tag all those anti-rape feminist tags to a character who didn't judge her girlfriend being pregnant and still wanted to marry her. Who became a maniac on realising she got married. Who was so crazy for her to give-up home, defy his father rather than moving on. Those who think the hero slapping his girlfriend as a decimation of feminism, fail to recognise his unconditional love and probably has never been in a relationship where the guy and girl are crazy about each other.",2019-06-25 6:20:22

We love talking about how open and inviting the biggest religion of India, Hinduism, is. We love talking about how Indians didn't conquer others and were still unfortunately enslaved by various outsiders.

I was reading Rudyard Kipling's *The Miracle of Purun Bhagat* https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kipling/rudyard/jungle2/chapter3.html. There's this statement about the price to be paid if you travel overseas, or you lose your caste/varna. If Rudyard Kipling wrote this just 100 years back, it was common knowledge back then too. I decided to read further about it, and no wonder that Indians were tied down to the land and not able to expand, because of the system in Hinduism called ""Samudrolanghana"". It also shows how Hindus looked down on outsiders and those not of the religion.

So they came up with new scam, verify mobile using aadhaar OTP.

That's bigger scam than fingerprint based verification.

1. Anyone who steals your mobile can own it for life by linking your aadhaar with that mobile. He can claim your identity at every place under the Sun. For example, he can change your bank password, since bank would not know, who is real and who is farzi.

2. OTP can be guessed  using brute force, OTP algorithm can be reverse engineered, stupid UIDAI would not be generating a real random number for OTP. You can write 10 lines code in browser to hack OTP. 

3. OTP has been allegedly arriving 3 days after requesting from UIDAI. The OTP is valid for 30 minutes only, which makes aadhaar based OTP useless.

4. Many people have complained that aadhaar servers are always down and they never receive OTP.

Any state that functions on freebies in free market only kills itself. I wish we take a lesson from countries such as Argentina, which are run on subsidies, free healthcare and infrastructure.

Well, it is a choice a leader makes. You can a loved leader of today (because of the freebies) but you will be a joke of tomorrow as you would have brought down a healthy(economically) state with you.

It might relieve some people of paying electricity and water bills today however, the future the generation will suffer unemployment and lack of competitive resources thanks to policies you are perpetuating.

Aam Aadmi Party was supposed to be a party with a difference, but even AAP has decided to play politics. In the short sightedness of increasing a vote bank the party is going to kill the economy of the state. People are not fools to not see through this.

Instead of free water, free electricity, free roads, free security shouldn't you/ AAP be concentrating to empowering people to pay for those facilities rather than making them beggars(people getting services for free). How to empower people is by creating jobs. Jobs given on the basis of merit not caste/senoirity/political agenda.

Why shouldn't the South secede?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8usph2/why_shouldnt_the_south_secede/,195.0,Politics,6.0,8usph2,SR7_cs,"Why shouldn't the United States of South India happen? The south is leaps and bounds ahead of the North in every way possible. The social indicators of the South like birth rate and even sex ratio are close to western EU standards.But the North have around 10 times worse rates.Economically, cities like Bangalore, Mumbai,Hyderabad and Chennai would have easily been cities of the size of NY,London and other HUGE cities in the world and they would be held to the same standard as well. I'm not going to deny that the South isn't perfect but a lot of the problems would have been solved if the South separated and dealt with it. As it is,there are place like the South Canara district which are so aware and educated that political parties can't put the usual crooks and idiots up for election because the people will actually vote for NOTA.

Aside from developmental purposes, the South is also culturally different from the North. And the people from North realised it was better staying in the south because of climate, job opportunity etc and now the number of north Indians are so huge in the south.Why is this a problem? They try and impose Hindi in a way, their families might have lived here for 10-20 years and they will hardly know a few words in the regional language.They expect everyone to speak Hindi with them even though over here English is probably more common than Hindi and is usually 2nd behind the local language.Other than this, they also brought the problems the North had in terms of social indicators here.

If you ask most people, I can guarantee they will say that Hindi is the national language of the country even though we have around 30 national languages, if you look at the country as a whole and not just by population, English is far more popular. When the country was formed after independence, the makers of the constitution convinced the southern states to join by promising them that the culture of the North wouldn't be imposed and made rules to accommodate this. Despite this the people continue to ignore our culture, lifestyle and values and expect everyone to follow them.

There is absolutely no reason the South should continue to be a part of the country. the country has fucked the South and expect to continue to live off the South's work and success.

I know this seems like a rant which it is to some extent (I saw an article that said a tourist was raped in Delhi and the govt says that they have no problem ensuring safety of women in the country. This is obviously a lie and they aren't even trying to deal with the problem.This happens in the south, not gonna deny but personally I feel more people here know why this crime has to be stopped and are willing to help while in my visits to the north the people itself, barring a few who are more educated and exposed to other culture, do not understand the problem. There are still towns where the govt knows families have children till they get a male child and kill all the female babies and do nothing about it because they don't see a reason to stop it), but honestly why should the South stay a part of the country? Are there people who are truly from the south who believe that there is no merit to exit?

[Article from April 2014]

- Between 2009-10 and 2011-12, non-agricultural employment grew rapidly.
- Between 1999-2000 to 2004-2005, the number of non-agricultural jobs created was 7.5 million per annum.  
- Between 2004-2005 and 2011-12 again, the number of non-agricultural jobs created was 7.5 million per annum.  

- The important point is that millions left agricultural work after 2004-05 on account of many new opportunities. Although 37 million persons left agriculture during the periods 2004-05 and 2011-12, they found work in non-agricultural activities, both rural and urban. In comparison, 20 million new workers joined agriculture between 1999-2004.

- Agriculture has grown much faster since 2005. In fact, during the 11th Plan, agricultural output grew at 3.2 per cent per annum (2007-12) on average, despite crippling drought in 2009-10 and despite the number of people leaving agriculture.  
- The reduction of people working in agricultural work is the first time in our history.   
- Services jobs grew by 11 million, and manufacturing employment increased by a remarkable nine million in two years alone (2009-10 and 2011-12), although manufacturing employment fell in absolute terms by three million between 2004-05 and 2009-10. 

- For the first time in the history of India, there was a decline in the absolute numbers of the poor after 2004-05; until then for nearly 30 years (1973-74 to 2004-5), there was a fall in the percentage, but not in the absolute numbers of the poor (322 million poor in 1973-74 and 302 million poor in 2004-05, by the Lakdawala poverty line). The decline in poverty was driven by a rise in real wages.  
- The new non-poor demand simple manufactured consumer goods: processed food (biscuits, milk), leather goods (shoes, sandals), furniture (plastic chairs/tables, wooden furniture), textiles, garments and mobiles. All these product areas and services saw a dramatic increase in employment between 2009-10 and 2011-12, primarily because these simple, low-end products (at least those consumed by the new non-poor) are produced in the unorganised sector, using labour-intensive methods.

http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/column-the-myth-of-jobless-growth/1099529/1 [ Article from Apr 2013 ]

-  It is inconceivable that such a massive increase in GDP (over four times) can take place without commensurate growth in employment, yet the government of India persists with this myth. This has been accentuated by incomplete and inconsistent data published by various government departments.

I demand Modi to immediately implement these ideas. I have already defended most of these ideas so i wouldn't spend much time doing the same thing here again.

Here are my one-line rational behind each of these ideas:

1. Pan India unemployment allowance: Modi promised jobs and he failed.

2. reservation in Private sector: Discriminatory hiring, unequal access to institutional, social and financial resources due to caste-system.

3. special status to Bihar and other Eastern-states: To make for the loss because of freight-equalization policy.

4. Re-allocation of MP seats: Allocation of MPs should reflect current demography for governance reasons.

There is lot of action on the ground.

* Increased taxes on petrol by around 8-10%. Petrol now costs more than aviation fuel.
* Increased service tax.
* Cleaned India on one particular day last year. It became so clean that it hasn't needed any cleaning since then. There is a plan to levy a 2% tax on everything to do this photo op annually.
* Got a nuclear treaty signed with US. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this for 7-8 years.
* Increased Foreign Investment in insurance to 51%. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this.
* Increased train fares. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this inspite of the railways being subsidised heavily and running at a loss.
* Put Modiji's photo on tea cups used in Railways.
* Allowing Foreign investment in retail. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this.
* Got clean chits for some party members (including the head of his party) who were facing criminal cases in the courts.
* Appointed a TV serial actress who dropped out of school at 17 as the head of our Education ministry.
* IIT Delhi Director resigned. Chairman of Board of Governors of IIT, Bombay resigned. Delhi University Vice Chancellor resigned.
* Arranged a 1 billion $ loan from a Government bank for the guy who provided him with aircraft and copters for his campaigning.
* Trying to push a GST bill through parliament. This is the same bill Modiji had opposed for 12 years when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
* Went full steam ahead on a National ID card project which he had criticised the previous government for heavily.
* Did Biryani politics with Pakistan.
* Renamed several programs of the previous government and relaunched them as new programs.
* Took credit for a few achievements of the previous government.
* The previous government had deregulated petrol prices. But the new government now controls deregulated fuel prices by tweaking taxes on petrol so that the price at the pump is regulated.
* Pressurized Governors appointed by Previous Government to resign. Those who didn't were transferred to whatever is the Indian equivalent of Siberia. Mizoram has seen 7 Governors in 8 months because of this.
* Announced India as an unstoppable force in Science by leaking out the fact that India invanted plastic surgery, planes and inter galactic travel.
* Appointed the kind of censor board committee which made us miss Leela Samson and her gang.
* Gave Padma Bhushan to the founder of the TV channel which is the pride of India - IndiaTV.

But Modiji's presidency shouldn't be just seen at the national level. His party has also done several great things at the state level.

* Banned beef in Maharashtra. You can be jailed for 5 years if you are caught with beef.
* They have a cow ministry in Rajasthan.
* Cows are going to be issued Aadhaar National ID cards in Rajasthan. Hoof Prints may be used for biometric authentication.
* Cows may also be provided photo id cards in Maharashtra.
* Religious Hindu texts to be made as mandatory study in schools in Haryana.
* No FIRs against bureaucrats, MLAs in Maharashtra with prior approval from the Government.
* Moving towards Doordarshan autonomy in Gujarat. One guy who reported news about Jashodaben's RTI application was transferred to the Andamans.
* Reservation for Marathas in Maharashtra. Aren't even an unprivileged community.

I absolutely hate how the present government has been handling multiple issues over the past few years and I honestly think that the country is being run by goons.

Now to this post - I dont really like how the whole COVID situation was handled. I abhor the way police is currently acting. I hate the fact that the 5 pm appreciation nonsense turned into a fucking shit show. I was just sitting cribbing about everything that was going on and then it just hit me - everything has become so god damn negative.

Sure I get it - the policemen are cunts controlled like puppets. Modi should have immediately made the press release instead of announcing at 8 pm. But come on - lets just give shit like the benefit of doubt for now. I was so aghast about 20000 Cr going towards damn beautification. I was so mad abut it that when 15000 Cr for COVID was announced I didnt even care to acknowledge it.

I was so frustrated with all the nonsense floating in the whatsapp groups as well. In this atmosphere, fake news and medical advice can have serious consequences so I started calling out my family members etc as politely as I could but it just didnt matter to them. They still forward the same shit even today.

We are late with the steps we have taken so far. We are probably hiding the infected numbers (which country isnt though?) but I am glad we are now doing something about it. We are late and we can only hope that we arent too late. I am not really asking to keep away the criticism - i am just saying the criticism can be put in a slightly non-negative manner.

So please don't downvote and kill this thread without even reading. 
Please convince me and tell me where I am going wrong. 



I see nothing wrong in prohibiting women or men in a particular temple or mosque or church. Or in certain sections of said mosque church temple. 



--Hinduism is made of thousands of different sects, belief systems, ideas etc so much so that if anyone tries to limit it to a set of beliefs like the RSS or. BJP sometimes do.. They will be in the wrong. 


-- This particular sect States that the deity is a celibate and does not want to come in contact with fertile women.

Why should it matter that it is stupid or intelligent or smart or foolish. 

It is a belief. All religious beliefs are man made and stupid according to me. But people are free to believe whatever they want to. This is religious freedom. 

-- As long as nobody is imposing their beliefs on others, and the belief is not causing harm to others...
We should respect it. We can critique it if we want to. But we shouldn't impose our own belief system onto others forcefully. 


-- Now somebody will say that this prohibition is causing harm to women. How? 


If you are a genuine devotee of Lord Ayappa or whatever the lords name is.. And you believe in this particular sect. You will believe that he doesn't want to come in contact with women. So why would any women want to do what the lord specifically did not want them to do. It is like a jain person doing animal sacrifice. Going completely against the basic tenet of the sect. 


That is why no women believing in the sect wants to go there.


And if you don't like this sect and its prohibition of visiting the deity in the temple, then change your sect, change your religion, become atheist...do whatever you want. 


And I don't see any harm if you don't get to go to this particular temple where the deity specifically wishes you not come. 


Go to other temples man. Or pray from the base of the temple or whatever. 


-- But what if I want to reform the religion, one might ask. I want to have a lord ayappa sect which welcomes women to touch the deity and take selfies with deity etc etc. Or whatever reform one wants to have. 


So start your own temple. Your own sect. Nobody is stopping you. If somebody stops you, then they will be wrong, and I will fight for your right to your religious freedom. 


Start your own lord ayappa sect and add many other idols of women around it. Make it only for women. Do whatever it is that you want to. Preach your new sect. 


For example- Homosexuality is prohibited in all abrahamic religions. 
A gay person cannot become the leader of a mosque or a church (technically).


You cannot force Delhi Jama Masjid or Kalkaji Church to allow a gay person to become the imam or the pastor who will lead the prayer. This is against religious freedom. 


But at the same time, gay Muslims and Christians can open up lgbt mosques and churches and welcome all people there. 


Gay Imam in LGBT friendly mosque in South Africa 
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-lgbt-religion-idUSKCN1PU0J9




-- Forcing your own belief systems onto religious sects and beliefs is wrong and stupid. 


If there is a bali sect among Hindus where goats and cattle are sacrificed, it is improper for other vegetarian Hindus to force them to stop their balis. 


And more so for the judiciary to meddle into the affairs of religion. 


You can try and reform. You can try and convince. You can start your own counter sect. But you cannot force. 


This is wrong.

When I questioned in the Pak page about the stances and double standards of their govt, I got suspended from posting. This subreddit here has been a major model that allows both sides of the coin an equal share! 


There have already been so many people showing concern towards the path that we have taken. It's a major crisis as we all know. It is the essence of democracy to speak truth to the power and this must be done no matter what! 
We have a whole generation to look after and we can't afford any kind of war or b.s now!


The Kaveri river has been calling us. It's drying out! Floods have become a frequent tragic every year and it's on us my people to save the nation. Imagine what would happen if a war occurs! Imagine the after effects. These are not the medieval or ancient times where people fought with swords and arrows. We have nuclear weapons on either side. Imagine the after effects of a WAR.  Imagine how many of our jawaans and citizens will loose their lives. 



We as a nation stand by our jawaans, THATS FOR SURE. AND WE SHOULD! But the political elite have been manipulating their positions in the eyes of the people. DONT LET THIS HAPPEN. 



The least you can do now is speak the truth. The truth in the end of the day always wins! So keep all your biases aside and see your fellow citizens who endures the same hardships as you and start becoming responsible citizens.

Doctors and hospital staff don't have PPE kits, and test kits. Tests kits ordered by the government have not been delivered, 5 deadlines missed. One of the lowest testing rates in both  absolute numbers and percentages. India's best government hospitals are faltering. We haven't been able to flatten the curve. Still this idiot has the gall to say we are in a better position. We are not. This regime has just not tested enough.

It typifies my mood: I truly feel a growing sense of impotent rage. Intolerance has always existed in this country, only never before has extremism been legitimised so brazenly by powerful sections of society. A man is lynched in Dadri and very few truly empathise with the grief of a poor family. Instead, rabble rousers continue to pursue their agenda to decide on what people should eat: the obvious aim is to stir a Hindu Muslim divide. Ink is thrown at a public figure, a music concert of one the greatest ghazal singers is stalled: the debate isn't about free artistic expression but becomes about who is 'patriotic' and who is not. Sahitya Akademi award winners return their awards and their right to dissent is not accepted; instead, they are abused and targeted as 'pseudo-intellectuals'. The new buzzword is 'selective outrage': if you didn't outrage about a crime against a Hindu you have no moral right to outrage when a Muslim is killed. Killings it seems have become a zero sum game: your riot versus mine. We don't spare anyone who might wish to break from the official narrative that seeks to promote majoritarianism in the garb of silencing all those who might insist on a greater reach out to the more vulnerable minority groups. When Naseeruddin Shah, arguably the finest stage actor of our generation, says he is being made conscious of his Muslim identity for the first time, being dubbed 'anti national' for attending a seminar, you wonder what kind of a civil society are we bequeathing to the next generation. Even our respected prime minister from whom we seek leadership and guidance will tweet to wish Navjot Sidhu a quick recovery from hospital but will not say a word on Akhlaq's family's loss.

* 1 Indian people quietly loathe, but accept the fairness mania.. everyone literally thinks it's OK to look at fairness as an attractive quality when choosing a husband/wife/boyfriend/girlfriend. 

You know we can't change our genotypes right? We will always be brown, or dark brown.

* 2 Indians put the language of the oppressive british regime, English, as one of the ""national"" languages. The ""good schools"" are christian schools with emphasis on english. 

Sure, the tamils don't speak hindi... then why not LEARN hindi instead of english. (hindi is closer to tamil as a language than english).

ENGLISH IS A NECESSARY LANGUAGE TO BE FLUENT IN, but it isn't required to be your primary language. (look at germany, japan, france, sweden..etc).

* 3 Many Indian Moslims think they're not even ""Indian"" ethnically. They believe they apparently are descended from ""arabs/persians"". (maybe 5% of them are... but this thinking is frighteningly more wide-spread than 5%)

* 4 Some Indian Christians tend to try to be more ""english"" or ""american"" RATHER THAN ""christian"". (I said some, not all) 

* 5 Many Hindus hate their scriptures, religion. Yes, many scriptures are clearly frightening (some puranas). But have you read a book as open-minded and philosophically rich as the Gita? or the ISA upanishad?

Do Indians have lesser IQ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eomv16/do_indians_have_lesser_iq/,25.0,AskIndia,2.0,eomv16,kanch08,"I want to say few things about me before I proceed to say anything about my observation. I am an Indian ,Hindu(""forward caste"" )  woman who settled in USA for last 20 years. I love my home country as much as USA, so no prejudice in my observation.

I have observed that the thought analyses of so called educated Indians is far less than Americans. I am beginning to wonder if we have lesser IQ(currently). My theory is stemmed from the following :

1. We never came out of our communal sentiments (caste based) even though we are aware it is all nonsense . We never even try to address it within ourselves nor we read extensively about its origins in school. Most general population never wonder why do we have ""classes"" within the same race? It is peculiar that communal sentiment is stronger than National sentiment. People actively participate in these sentiments.
2. We submit too much to ""gurus"" without making thorough investigation of them. We support their pseudo science because it protects our insecurities . We are fine with them occupying lands, controlling wealth , preaching enormous ignorance . They give lame explanations of effect of Saturn on some temples and why women should don't enter them. We never question the science behind it.
3. Our theatre arts (cinema ) is at its worst. We are such snowflakes that directors lives are threatened if they take movies that ""hurt"" communal sentiments. We don't want to hear truths . Or alt least look at it and judge it ourselves without making a huge political stunts. And unfortunately people support it. They have to always distort the truth to please the audience. What kind of cowardice is that? What's the purpose of the art?
4. There are no Science-fiction movies that can be thoughtful...like Inception, Martian or Interstallar . Most Indians don't even discuss these movies, let alone produce them. I wonder how much of our population even understand them or want to watch them?
5. We read more of current day to day politics than any other books out there. Never try to understand to go and think beyond. There is more interest in vanity (flaunting their cars, assets ) than acquiring knowledge.
6. Very egoistic and arrogant  but surprisingly devotees of either politicians , gurus or heroes. Their bhakti is unmatched to any other world .
7. They hesitate to question anything ancient and sacred. Lack of analytical skills?....
8. Our politicians represent our moral sense and values.
9. They believe that being educated is reading bunch class text books and ace the exams. Parents are extremely proud of their kids achievements and very ashamed of those who are academically backward( I mean those who can't boring drill for hours??)
10. They don't even read  their scriptures but have a very high feeling of them. The question is they don't read but yet they feel proud of it..
11. The list goes on.................",2020-01-15 5:09:37

* Use of pellet guns

* Rape (I don't have proof, but i know it's been happening, although this can be omitted from the list on the basis of No proof)

* murder (This one, you decide)

A parent won't have any difficulty to understand this : if your child's life are at stake then 9/10 parents won't care about law/rules/regulation/government atall, it's not even in your control to think about law it's just your body's reaction.

**Now here is the thing :** As we and the whole world knows pakistan's primary defense/offence is terrorism, it's part of who they are (it's indoctrinated through the web of madrasahs, just read about hafiz saeed).

All they have to do is transport guns and weapons to kashmir, **Before** this whole mess, the people of kashmir wouldn't accept any such weapon at large. But now they don't know if they are safe or not, and specially they don't know if their kids are safe or not. 
**Now** i think most of the kashmiris would accept weapons if they had a chance. Pakistan Govt. and army both would be more than eager to do this.

And then only a fire is needed to start a wildfire (something like Kathua rape case). 

**If kashmiris pick up arms against government now. would/should it be considered terrorism?**

I know it would be considered terrorism for sure because that's what government would call it and media would scream, if BJP/RSS can arrest activist who fight for villagers and other communities who don't have any voice In a cooked up case of terrorism([This](https://thewire.in/politics/modi-assassination-plot-letter-danger-democracy))  than i am pretty sure they would be called terrorist.

The sort you talk about everything with.

Because I don't see how it would be possible then to not notice the deliberate and relentless BJP strategy to 'otherify' and gradually dehumanize Indian Muslims.

I don't see how it would be possible not to see the pain, hurt, anger, and anxiety that is being consciously being imposed on hundreds of millions of our people through chilling planned incremental violations.

I don't see how it would be possible not to be viscerally disgusted and to not recoil from that agenda.

I just don't see how.

PS: And by the way, I am no fan of Islam or any other religion. I think they are ALL ignorant, divisive, and regressive ideologies.

The modus operandi is this

A week before the blog, a lot of influencers would talk of Women's day and harassment at work place. Slowly these anon twitter accounts would swoop in and publish this blog. This blog was intentionally badly written to make it appear dubious. And once enough traction has been achieved, some more twitter influencers would tweet claiming a lot of people has messaged them telling their experiences with this guy. Then the rebuttal from TVF was carefully worded to provoke people and appear insensitive. At this point, the FB post was planned to be posted. She would then play it for a week and then reveal to the entire world what a horrible thing work place harassment is for the women. This would coincide with the first stream of their web series.

The tragedy occurred after scores of slum residents in Malwani, a northern suburb, bought and consumed methanol-infused hooch from local bootleggers. The concentration of toxic methanol in the hooch was high enough to send more than a hundred consumers to the hospital with complaints of breathlessness, stomach aches and failing vision.

DAE Think that there is a huge conspiracy underfoot to discredit India.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3a9bdt/dae_think_that_there_is_a_huge_conspiracy/,50.0,Non-Political,16.0,3a9bdt,sloridia,"So I am not the kind of person who believes in conspiracy theories, but the turn of events over this year has me broadly convinced that the Indian MSM is working against our interests and there is a larger cabal with sufficient economic resources and a clear agenda driving it. 

I think it all started with the Modi govt. banning NGOs. So, I was one of those who thought that this was a retrograde move. A lot of NGO's do good - I know for a fact that a lot of implicit missionary activities goes on behind the scenes, but I have no problem if people convert to christianity so that they can make bread. The christian missionaries might have ulterior motives - but its still fine with me. The poor of this country are better of with bread and god, than neither. 

I think all this media manipulation started of post this act of hte Modi govt.. When NGO's were pumping money into India, there was a relatively easy channel to 'wake up' our population to the service of Jesus. But the ban on NGO's put water to by and large this act which had been going unhindered for a couple of decades now. The media manipulation that we are seeing now, is partly a response to this act of the Modi govt. and partly a newer and more effective strategy to bring Jesus into our lives. It is this more effective strategy which has rankled me most.

Even though Indians might see themselves a secular country, the world - and by and large the western world, does not. For the west India is broadly Hindu - the failings of India are by and large the failings of Hinduism. The media strategy is amazingly effective because it does not need to direct Hindusim - what it does instead is direct India itself and it is left to the imagination of the audience to make that connect with Hindusim. This, as most marketing gurus will tell you, is one of the most effective marketing ploys. Do not sell water to the thirsty, but glorify the beauty of your wells and let people make that connect in their minds. 

I think it is broadly known that a lot of agencies which funds NGO's in India also have significant interests in the media. Add to that delipidated law and order infrastructure in the country and lot of medieval social/cultural mores still present in parts of the society makes India the perfect hot spot for these kind of shenanigans. A population which is acutely aware of their failings is the perfect ground for the harvesting of souls - the societies which come from Jesus do not have any such social ills and this connect is left for the audience to make for themselves.

The biggest success of this strategy was obviously the delhi rape incident and the documentary behind it. However, I would like to give credit to the home minister Rajnath singh, who acted like a rank amateur here and walked into the trap by banning it. The documentary was shoddily made and it would have died a natural death had it not been for the home minister who is probably the weakest link in the modi govt. However, credit should also be given to NDTV who went on a rampage and raped India in broad daylight. Barkha dutt defending India was either born out of her realisation that her game is being outed and so that she can salvage whatever little credibility is left.

The thing is that this game is not over yet and everyday I am reading news reports which try to play up this angle. There was something on bachelors not getting rents or maybe it was muslims. Then there was the thing about a muslim guy being denied jobs. The thing is that in a country as diverse as India, these things will always happen in a certain number. Even then India is significantly less discriminatory then for example say America which has incredible amount of rascism between blacks, whites and browns.",2015-06-18 20:13:06

The most successful Kings of India were all non Vedic.And the most foolish were Vedic. A Historical recap for Trivedi Goel.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38i1b7/the_most_successful_kings_of_india_were_all_non/,26.0,Politics,0.0,38i1b7,Shivrajsingsong,"1) Let us analyse the greatest of Kings of India and abroad and the most foolish of them from pre - medieval and Medeival History.

One thing will be clear globally

1) The Most successful ones were (So to speak Pagans), but they were not Banias (Followers of Vedas, Puranas  or from any Gotra)but independent men who believed in meritocracy.

2)The most foolish ones, the least successful ones were all Vedic.

The backdrop of this analysis is the most basic classification of people. Devas and Asuras. Anyone who followed the Vedic system and adhered to the principles of the Banias and Brahmins were connoted as Devas and the ones who did not were connoted as Asuras as per the more populous Gotras(Then and till today, the combined gotra populations make the Gotra groups of India one of the most widely entrenched, populous and vast social networks of non productive vegetables the planet has ever seen).We can consider the world as a one whole instead of nation states, in that era. We do not analyse prehistory,in a time when Vishnu and Ram and other Vedic Gods did not exist but medieval History. We will pit Human Asuras (So to speak) against Vedic Gods(So to speak) and compare their achievements. 

1) Ram

Genus :  Bania (Indo Aryan)

Achievements: Did nothing, built no monument, unverified birth location, convinced one group of natives(Marathi monkeys as per Ramayan) to attack a smaller group of natives( South Indians) to avenge the shame of his wife running away with the Richer, Technologically Advanced, Aerial Car Driving Southern King after his wife crossed the Lakshman Rekha. Finally committed suicide after dumping his unchaste wife.(Aum).

2)Parashuram

Genus: Indo Aryan (Bania)
Achievements :  Did nothing,built no monuments, settled some Banias into the southern Lands of Kerala. Murdered his mother who was tempted by Rich native men, unverified existence.

3) Vamana:

Genus :  Dwarf Brahmin ( Indo Aryan), came to Kerala with a group of Brahmins, asked King Mahabali for land and then back-stabbed him by exploding Bania population.

4) Krishna

Genus :  3rd class Indo Aryan(Mixed Blood between Native and Indo Aryan)

Achievements: Did nothing, instigated war and propounded already well established Cosmic Philosophy from the Sramana system and packaged it well.Built nothing.Died by a hunters arrow.

5) Other small Vedic Fish : Bimbisara, Ajatashatru ..did nothing.

Non Vedic Heroes(Asuras):

1) Ashoka( Native, Bihari) -  Conquered all of Northern India until he converted to Buddhism.

2) Kanishka,(A Kushan King, Non Vedic) - Conquered all of Northern India till the Tarim Basin in Central Asia.

3)Alexander -  Conquered 1/2 the known world.Built Alexandria

4) Genghis Khan - Conquered the World

5)Cyrus the Great -  Conquered the Known World, built Persepolis

6) Ashurbanipal -  Conquered the known world, Built the Largest ancient Library.

7) Nebuchadenezzar -  Conquered the known world, sacked Jerusalem.

8) Sargon of Akkad -  Root for the word, Sarrukin (Now Sharukh Khan), built Sumeria and conquered the known world.

9) Raja Raja Chola -  Conquered from South of India till the Ganges, built Gangai Konda Cholapuram and Brihadeeshwara Temple.

Akbar, Timur and others...not to mention.

We can consistently see why India is poor, because the Vedic people(Devas) and their kings are non inspirational and have noo aspiration and light in them. All they want to do is say Aum and drink milk,play holy with the cows ets and ban eggs in anganwadis. Basically, Goels lives the life of an insect and then come back to live the life of an insect.And India stays, malnourished, backward and poor.For there is noo light in the Vedas.

Kabir Singh - Why I dont watch Bollywood movies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce0gaa/kabir_singh_why_i_dont_watch_bollywood_movies/,14.0,Non-Political,3.0,ce0gaa,fuckyallmat,"I hardly watch 3-4 bollywood movies in a year. To put this into perspective, I watch 100+ movies every year and this year I have already watched 104 movies. Anyway, I stopped watching bollywood movies after 2012(Jab Tak Hain Jaan's story gave my brain permanent retardation and incurable cancer). Anyway, a junior was recommending me Kabir Singh since 1st July, and I was reluctant and hesitant to watch this movie. So today I went and watched this movie. 
Here's my review and ratings -
Rating 2/5...
The cinematography and acting was awesome. Shahid Kapoor's acting was 5/5. I don't have any problem with the misogynistic, drug abusive, violent portrayal of Kabir Singh,because it's just a character. The first half of the movie felt like I was watching something new and refreshing from Bollywood. But things started getting downhill as soon Preeti got married. The story went down the drain, like why was he allowed to perform surgeries in intoxicated states? And he gets punished when he didnt want to perform the surgery but he had no other options, then the logic started going out of the window, suddenly this and that happens, suddenly when he plans to move one, Preeti is conveniently single/seperatee and she didn't even let the other guy touch him. And they get married and Happyzzz Endingzzzz!!! Cliched bollywood. Omg!!! For once why cant they write something different and why are most of the Bollywood's storyline pure garbage??? Like who eats up this shit and doesnt get brain cancer?? 
Just came back an hour ago from this pathetic movie, I wish I had stayed home and watched Euphoria season 1 Episode 5 instead. Never going to watch a Bollywood movie unless it gets nominated for Oscars or something. Rant over.",2019-07-17 7:20:43

CMV: Triple Talaq is a Progressive Law,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5a5273/cmv_triple_talaq_is_a_progressive_law/,61.0,Politics,3.0,5a5273,phelpme2,"Triple talaq has been dismissed as medieval and barbaric piece of shitty sexist law and people  supporting it are called creeps.

Wait a minute.....

And what exactly is the other option? Not allowing divorce at all? Feminists talk about consent. Like consent can be granted and then taken back. But when it comes to marriage, once you get married you cannot get out of marriage without the other person allowing to it. 

Considering India where there are loads of arranged marriages and many forced or persons don't exactly know their partners properly, not allowing divorce without partners consent is not exactly progressive. It's just like forced marriages. I haven't seen anyone speak against this oppression of forcing people to stay in marriages. All this talk of banning unilateral divorce for men instead of talking about allowing unilateral divorce for women shows this issue is not about barbaric laws. It's about muslims. 

Triple talaq is just instantaneous unilateral divorce. It's not medieval or barbaric. It's pretty progressive. The only objection which women's rights activists can say against it is that it's available only for men. But when instead of that, when they talk about banning unilateral divorce for men also, I cannot take them seriously. 

Its not just men, Muslim women also have options to end marriage unilaterally. There are already two provisions in the Muslim Personal Law. 

1) Talaq e Tafweez - Delegated divorce. The wife demands right of divorce when getting married. If this right is included in the marriage contract, then she can issue divorce just like triple talaq. Only thing is that it's not included by default. 

2) Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage(Khula) - When the wife cannot tolerate her husband or doesn't like him she can file for divorce. This doesn't require the consent of her husband. Also it's available only under Muslim Personal Law. 

In all other personal laws one cannot get out of marriage without mutual consent. You are forced to stay in marriage against your will. I don't see why nobody is speaking up against such forced marriages?

In fact BJP government dropped the Irretrievable breakdown of marriage for grounds for divorce.

http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-to-make-divorce-easier-may-be-dropped/article6910089.ece


>Groups opposing the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill contend that it will cause an increase in ""illegitimate and live-in relations and thereby a fall of the institution of marriage and family values.""

Since then the Supreme Court has on a number of occasions recommended the inclusion of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce.

BJP does kulcha nonsense and opposes amendment of Hindu law while acting as women's rights activist in case of Muslim personal law.

There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands.

 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 Â°C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 
Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

"Help, ideas needed. HLL poisoned my village with mercury. There have been 250 cancer deaths in just 5 years in just my tiny village. Se[r]ious replies only.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38heyu/help_ideas_needed_hll_poisoned_my_village_with/,257.0,[R]eddiquette,8048.0,38heyu,UnileverCancerFactor,"I don't want to leave this be, and need some help on which NGO's might be interested in fighting this case.
**Background Reading**
* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)
The summary of these articles would be as follows,
A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.
HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.
A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.
What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.
I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 
If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.
I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.
Further studies in case you are interested.
[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 
[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).
>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 Âµg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 Âµg/kg and 8.3 Âµg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.
>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.
This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 
Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.
edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.
To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.
edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.
I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.
Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM.",2015-06-04 19:24:17

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a âdaredevil selfieâ when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 
The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.
**Actual Events:**
Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngstersâ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.
**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.
All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 
I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.
This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 
For Pranita.

 Although words cannot express how greatful I am to Reddit India, words are all I have. So please accept my sincerest appreciation for what you guys have done today, you have, even though you are hundreds of miles from her parents , reduced their suffering in a small way.

Thankyou all for believing this story.
Thankyou guys so much once again, and thanks to the mods for being so cooperative. Thankyou ScoopWhoop for owning up to the mistake and not ignoring the truth when it came out. This post is now being circulated all over facebook and my college thanks to the efforts of reddit India.
 
 To Pranita, 
I hope you are in a better place, the college will forever miss seeing your radiating smile everyday.

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way
* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.
* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan
* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law
* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case
* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No
* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution â Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent â religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries
* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan
* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils
* Doesnât India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Now, let's address them. 
>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.
That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 
NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048
**[Hereâs Amit Shah saying non-Muslims wonât even need to submit documents for NRC since theyâll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**
>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 
So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 
>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go throâ the usual process of acquiring citizenship throâ naturalization rulesâ¦.11 years of residence etc.
No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 
>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.
Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 
>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.
That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 
[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugeesâ those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born hereâ fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)
>Doesnât India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.
All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 
>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve
Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries.

>Why shouldnât Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category
Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e69fln/possible_scam_on_the_huge_youtube_tech_channel/,313.0,AskIndia,2387.0,e69fln,javapyscript,"Hello everyone,
I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.
I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.
Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.
&#x200B;
Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.
Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""
So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.
Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.
email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)
My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)
Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.
Thanks.
&#x200B;
Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 
Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 
Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 
Update 4: RIP inbox.
Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!
Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today.

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 
So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.
Fun Fact: 
* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.
I could do all these as I was using office address, whose entry was heavily regulated under STPI laws. **It is 10 years now, but I have been told to never talk about this to anyone, else I may get killed.** Crazy.",2018-05-17 14:48:45

People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,138.0,[R]eddiquette,2260.0,ar504q,askquestionsdude,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 
Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):
    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)
CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 
The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).
CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 
>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience
>âWeâre like a body,â he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. âJust because the heart is more important, you canât ignore the knee.â
CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 
>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.
They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.
> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".
TL;DR:
We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 
But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

Traffic was insane, I was tired, and there were a ton of people in the street. When my Uber arrived, I looked around and realized the super nice, noise canceling headphones I bought before I left the U.S. were gone. I probably got distracted and someone picked them up when I wasn't looking. I was angry at myself for being dumb. I've since been pricing new headphones.
Last night, I got done at the gym and went to the supermarket next to the gym to grab some food. After checking out, the cashier pulled me over to the side of the store and took my headphones out from a cubby by the counter. He saw me drop them nearly 2 weeks ago and grabbed them for me. I'm completely shocked, grateful, and appreciative as this would be a highly unlikely scenario in the U.S. Living/working in India has already been an amazing experience and this only makes it better.",2018-12-29 18:18:20

My Covid-19 quarantine experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,158.0,Non-Political,1944.0,ffyots,21Dec1989,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought Iâll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.
This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he letâs me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesnât check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24
A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didnât want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didnât) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.
My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital âheldâ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ânegativeâ for the virus.
The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and youâre away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.
TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 
If you have symptoms, report yourself.",2020-03-10 7:24:34

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.
So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.
 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.
Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 
There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.
Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.
All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words. 
Name of boy - Ivaan
Have a blessed day all!

"[NP] I called the police and ambulance on a road accident victim.

Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.
I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.
The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.
So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.
As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.
In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.
The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;
Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.
They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.
I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.
I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.
The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".
To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.
Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.
Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.
If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 
If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.
Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 
TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.
Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone.

A lady came rushing and went straight to the window , at this moment 10-12 mins must have passed and queue was growing as 2 major trains depart and morning rush hour had begun.
I requested her to join the line and got a reply âtrain is about to come , will miss itâ . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her.

Also I donât know why 80% of us donât speak up against these literate fools who think they have the right to oppress other fellow citizens.

The college was not so supportive and banks were reluctant because for some reason I can't get study loan between the course, and some have not even replied till date.
I had offered to create app/website for randians in exchange of some loan, but instead the community came together helped me raise enough amount that I could pay my final year college fee, something i never expected from my fav sub.
I really want to thank the mods who helped me with the idea of fund raiser, 25 of you who helped me financially and hundreds of individual who offered useful  advice, kept asking me if I needed any more help, some were even willing to offer me internship/projects to work on to cover my expenses. It's due to r/India that I was finally able to [pay my fee](https://i.imgur.com/cmP1DXM.png) with a fine of Rs. 200 though.
Not only the community where I have spent hundreds of hours helped me in most generous way possible, as a result of my post seeking help, I made few friends and got to talk to experienced individuals who gave me useful advice related to my college, career and the world in general.
I am really thankful to this community and the mods for helping me out. The community didn't only help me in this case but also my dozens of other posts asking advice for ""friend"" and my alts :D

"Hotstar is censoring anything remotely against Disney, even jokes!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dyvv0j/hotstar_is_censoring_anything_remotely_against/,227.0,Non-Political,1750.0,dyvv0j,vijayhere,"So I observed this yesterday while watching John Oliver's Last week tonight on hotstar. He makes jokes on Disney(He jokes on many people, corporations anyway). I observed a cut in scene and suspected a censorship. Immediately went to YouTube and watched that particular segment, which clearly didn't have anything censored. This was a particular recurring scene where he says ""Disney Facts"" over a set of jokes.
Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.
Edit : 
This blew up more than I thought it would. NDTV published an article on this reddit post. Hope hotstar stops censoring. Great going guys!

The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.
**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government: 

[Advocate Rohit Bras de Sa files letter petition before HC on account of scarcity of essential commodities & lack of machanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers, says people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days](https://twitter.com/prudentgoa/status/1243101931666468869)

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue:

And, many of them are coming online for the first time.

Just like how you were once new to the internet and you were amazed and puzzled by different things, they will also experience the same, but the difference is that they are like the new student who joined the school in the middle of the year. They have to now put twice as effort than you did in the past because everything has evolved so much and there are so many things to know about.

They are new to everything and they will be naive. They will fall into scams and will be exploited. They will be made fun of as they don't know the social etiquette of the internet which you have got used to. They may not even understand English properly or may not understand the underlying technologies which may seem obvious to you.

However, remember that you were also like that once up a time. Perhaps you were privileged to be able to use the internet while it was still a young new thing, but imagine how you would have felt if everyone you met online were a bully to you. Remember that Internet became what it is because there were forums and sites for helping each other on every topic you can think of.

I am saying this because I often see new users being abused by the Internet as the whole.

Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/,353.0,Politics,1635.0,e5rae3,rehnedeyaar,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder.",2019-12-04 14:42:26

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases arenât that many but theyâre increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesnât. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate âflu clinicâ and donât even see the face of the screening centre. I donât know whether the government canât afford the testing kits or it doesnât want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I wonât test them. Theyâre frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between. I used to be the kind of person who would reach first to the hospital and would be the last to leave but I hate going to work now, I dread talking to people knowing all I am going to do is let them down. Not to mention the hardships I have to face just to reach the hospital from my place of residence because our government has shut down literally every mode of conveyance. So I walk an hour everyday to work only to be cursed by patients and only to put my own health at risk. Please advise your children to not become a doctor.

Thugs in front of me start a fight with me unprovoked because I did not stand up for the national anthem.

I get hit on the face and they incite a crowd against me. They close in and shouting threats to my life.

INOX PULLS ME OUT, and left the thugs there. Thank e manager was flippant towards me and when the police got involved he wrote his case report supporting the mob and against me.

The thugs basically write some hit down and are left free. I was detained for bogus charges for not standing up and 'hurting the dignity of the soverign nation'

Not one person stood up for me when a mob threated my life. I am absolutely disgusted with everyone that was present yesterday.

Im still seething from the injustice and urge you all to boycott inox. That was absolutely unacceptable.

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. 

Barun Biswas, a school teacher organized the villagers against these demons. He led the raped women to go to the police and media. The whole village came out to support the teacher in his fight for justice.

After that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.

In 2002, Barun was shot dead by some of the freed members of that gang near Goboardanga railway station while returning from his school. He is a real hero and people of the area still revered him as a legend.

^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:
* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean
^If ^youâre ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^thatâs ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^youâve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.
^Itâs ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.
1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you donât have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless itâs absolutely essential. Donât take the bus, subway or even a taxi.
2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people â in your home, or in a car, because youâre on your way to see a doctor (and only after youâve called first) â wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.
3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you havenât just washed them.
4. **DISINFECTING**: Donât share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.
5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if youâre touching anything that might carry the patientâs bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

He spent his last days fasting for a clean Ganga in 2018. He died after 112 days.**

Prof. G. D. Agarwal, alma mater IIT Roorkee UC Berkeley, died from a fast-unto-death to protest against environmentally destructive projects on Ganga and Bhagirathi .

He was extremely vocal against illegal river sand mining.
Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 
With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.
I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.
Why do you think mainstream media wants us to focus on Timur ?
Shame on each and every Indian for not knowing about him and his life struggle when he was alive and fighting on our behalf.",2020-04-20 23:00:06

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.
Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 
After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.
Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.
After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.
TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.
Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad's healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.",2020-04-20 19:06:40

Why do Indian Men Love to Pose as Women Online?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4pb9i/why_do_indian_men_love_to_pose_as_women_online/,25.0,AskIndia,33.0,g4pb9i,pampara_vitti,"Ever since we were hit with the social media wave, Indian men have taken it upon themselves to hide behind the screen under the guise of being a woman. We all have heard tales of the infamous Angel Priya or an Aswathy Achu who have lured scores of desperate men with fake profile pictures and posts which are usually obtained from a hasty google search, the latest being a Nisha Jindal who happens to be a 31 year old male from Raipur . Some use this as a tactic for extorting money from helpless and desperate victims. But the others seemingly do it for the following or the pleasure of having many men following them because it's an outlet for their pent up aggression from being starved of sex or contact with women

Pricing of Electronic Products in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4vp81/pricing_of_electronic_products_in_india/,5.0,AskIndia,7.0,g4vp81,Av_Inash,"I wanted to know how does pricing and the associated components to it actually work in India. This is in context to the recent launch of the iPhone SE and the OnePlus 8 models. The iPhone SE is launched at $399 which translates to around Rs.30000. On the other hand the OnePlus pricing started at $699 which translates to around Rs.54000.
However by the time these products actually come to India the iPhone SE is actually somewhere around Rs.42000. On the other hand, OnePlus is able to launch its phones in India at a lower price - Rs 42000 in comparison to the starting Rs. 54000. How is this possible? Are the custom & GST rules different for companies based out of different countries? Or is there a different angle or dynamic to it?",2020-04-21 5:44:16

Price of testing kits should be based on income.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4lkpv/price_of_testing_kits_should_be_based_on_income/,18.0,Coronavirus,6.0,g4lkpv,I_can_believe_that,"Nearly, 92% female and 82% male workers in India earn earn less than 10,000 per month, since most of them canât afford to pay for test kits all government testing labs should be reserved for people of households with income below 10k pm, they should be tested for free. 
People from households with income more than 10,000 per month have to pay some amounts (with some subsidies depending on income) for testing and should be tested at private labs only.
People in the bracket 10,000 pm to 20,000 pm arenât exactly well-off either they should pay â¹500 per test.
People in the bracket 20,000 -50,000 can pay in 1000s, therefore, they should pay â¹2,500 per test.
People in the bracket 50,000 - 100,000 are pretty well off and should pay â¹4,500 per test.
People earning above â¹1 lakh per month should pay â¹5,000 per test. 
And people earning above â¹2 lakh per month should pay â¹6,500 per test.
The point of well earning people paying more is that theyâd be able to fund Indian based manufacturers to boost their production of rapid-testing kits and also the number of private labs. Government bidding test kits from foreign countries should have separate budget, as usual. 
As of now, almost all Indian based companies are planning to keep the cost below â¹2,000
Assuming weâve got 650,000 test kits from China 3 days ago with some stocks and  two of our local companies HLL and Voxtur that have begun production and expect to produce 100,000 by the end of the week. With more fundings they should be able to meet or even surpass the foreign bought rapid test kits in production units.
Hypothetically, if everything goes well, we might be able to cross million tests mark by the end of April.",2020-04-20 17:13:14

"[NSFW maybe] What was always ubiquitous in schools, but people don't like to talk about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4919v/nsfw_maybe_what_was_always_ubiquitous_in_schools/,15.0,AskIndia,31.0,g4919v,ainy_jaffri,"I wanted to say some memories from early school. Nothing shocking, just normal things, thoughts ... 
What do you make of your frame-of-mind when you used to go to school (as in before class 9)? Sometimes, talking to people in my college or other places, I feel that they've forgotten our point of view from even the recent past. And everyone just accepts that kids are naive in one way. Everything's normal if we just accept that we're worse today than how we used to be when we were that little.
So is it right? Whatever age you are now, you probably remember having choice when you were half your age, don't you? If you're a bigger sibling or a parent reading this, do you wory that you can't do enough for the kids?
You may have gone to a good school, or not at all -- who knows really what is worse; but school like I remember was never a place where I went to study good things like math and science and geography. Everyday we play-acted the Lord of the Flies.
These thoughts/memories are not in any order. I'm just writing them as I remember off the top of my head ...
In your experience, when did you first notice developing hierarchies in schools (and not caused by the administration directly)? My earliest memory is from when I was in class 4 or 5. There was in my class one student who was a repeater, so he was older and taller than the rest us. All the other boys looked up to him. My parents never gave me a phone or a computer even until much later, and I was not bright either, so I was impressed by anyone that seemed to have a clue. In this class and being in the cool-only group, we played cricket and football in break time and other time we sniffed dendrite and whitener and the obvious things you can guess, while the adults had no clue or didn't care what went on in the last benches. I learned also that I could make the best grades in class easily when I focused my mind, which wasn't easy.
Did the faculty keep the rooms clean? Many times in empty classrooms there was left in one corner or inside a desk, empty pepsi/fanta-type bottles into which someone had ejaculated. This kind of usual stuff, like also the fan blades being bent etc., happened from mid-school to maybe class 8. There's some version of this everywhere. This one I've only heard from others: Some guy peed in (or spat in) someone's waterbottle and put it back in the victim's school bag.
Do you agree with the notion that some cousin of racism has always been present in our schools, even from the first day? I don't remember that far back, but as far as I can, I call it by that name. Like if we can think of the worst racist bigot in politics, and multiply that by 10, there's the equivalent of the classmates I had growing up. haha! It's funny saying it that way. It's cute now that we get outraged when some public personality lets out a distasteful opinion. I hate it too, but I wish we stopped acting surprised. From what I remember, growing up in our schools: people's skin colour, weight, speech impediment, financial status, any disability was always fair game. And the teacher's were not innocent. They used racial slur's all the time, and strangely, there were some teachers who were plain cruel. People who come straight out of a horror movie. Umm ... it just seemed odd that for no reason at all, a teacher would twist someone's surname into something nasty-sounding, or pull a sardar joke out of his ass while waiting for the bell to ring. 
We would haze very badly, anyone who is gay. I was so dumb that I thought for sure that gay means something bad (because of a Aamir Khan movie I saw). In school there was only one person who explicitly identified in this way. I never got a chance to say sorry. Even when that person would cry we would come again the next day and call him names and attach his name with some other guy and bully. Beats me that we got away with this.
In class 6 or 7, I think, sometimes our subject teacher was absent. Other teachers started to pop-in from time-to-time to check and punish anyone that was out seat. Students invented were weird ways to pass the boredom, like one that went like this. Because we couldn't go anywhere, the ""dare"" part of the truth-or-dare game was removed and the truth-teller had to now compulsorily pick from one of the options. The only point was to humiliate a new guy by making him say stupid shit. Always it's the same question: whose dick would you suck? The older players pressured the new guy until he said some other guy's name. Then the older players say something like ""but why not this other one? what's wrong with this color?"" Then the new seemingly straight guy tries to clarify and digs his own grave, while the rest egg him on. Kinda weird we came up with this prank. Freud would've something to say about this.
One girl from where I worked told me this. In elementary grade, her best friend (girl) had facial hair slightly excess. Her conservative parents ""sent her to school to study and not focus on fashion."" One day her classmates teamed up and secretly drew a face with large moustache with chalk and wrote her name on blackboard. Everyone saw this and laughed at her and she cried. This happened in front of the teacher and the full class (they had some loadshedding situation that allowed opportunity for this particular prank). After this incident she never went back to that school. Don't worry, she's still alive. She felt very hurt and convinced her parents, then they pulled strings to tranfer her to different school. Maybe she was holding her depression for long time and what was funny for others was unbearably hurtful. (unrelated, but have you seen that funny video of the penis cat permanent marker prank on the teacher?)
This is my memory from class 5 or 6. I still feel angry if I think of it. I don't care now I guess. I had got the feeling that a gym teacher was following me around in school. He was a grey haired stoutish guy who also taught karate or something to students. It was not a overt ""tag you're it"" kind of following. That's why I never told anyone because it's very strange and I think no one will believe me. I just saw this asshole appear out of nowhere like right beside me talking to another teacher or near the door or any entrance and talking to another teacher right at the moment I was walking past it. Every morning after chapel when we lined up to go back to class, he seemed to somehow end up in line ahead or behind from me either immediately or there was one or two students between us. I didn't know who to complain to or what I will say in the complain. He was well-respected in school as he was involved whenever charity event or activity happened. He didn't make eye contact or anything but you have no idea what that felt like when suddenly I saw him crossing my classroom on any days for no reason. This creepy behaviour was making me depressed day by day. After class 6, the classes were in different building in different location in the city. I was relieved to never have to see this creep again. Now that I'm in college, even though I'm living in different city, I wish I meet him randomly on the street sometime because I'll kick the living shit out of him.
My classmates and I, had heard of planchettes and that stuff for the first time in class 7. We are very dense, especially I. Anyway, there was this fainting technique/trend whatever-it's-called that we had heard recently. A person had to perform a few moves (I don't think it's necessary that I list our version here) and this would cause them to pass-out (probably due to lack of oxygen in the brain or something). One of my friends volunteered or maybe we evilly coaxed him into it. That evening, the seven of us went to a friend's home, to test if the fainting thing actually works. In the friend's room, it was now night. We stood surrounding him just far enough that he wouldn't fall and break his neck and die (but really we were not paying attention because we doubted it would even work). On the third attempt he suddenly started walking and jumped from the top of a staircase straight to the bottom. The rest of us almost shit our pants, and for a few seconds we froze instead of running to help our friend. Only I went to check the corpse, but when I reached the landing, our friend had begun to get up on his own. He had this cool new gash above his eye and blood dripping, and just stared at me wondering why we were staring back at him! like we'd seen a ghost! He had no memory of jumping or fainting or the pain of the forehead splitting. We went together the six of us to hospital (one of the guys called a taxi and went home, I thought he literally shat himself), and got his forehead stitched up.

why are so many indians and sri lankans so arrogant?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4i22d/why_are_so_many_indians_and_sri_lankans_so/,7.0,AskIndia,5.0,g4i22d,Rimbaud33,"I know they're not the same but i will just say india instead of saying ""India and sri lanka"" every single time because india is more relevant to my subjective experience and because of simplicity, so im not meaning to offend anybody but i've met people from both bakcgrounds and i like and respect their culture but i've noticed something that i usually ignore unitl it's just too annoying
&#x200B;
So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).
Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.
&#x200B;
Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.
&#x200B;
I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?
&#x200B;
Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.
&#x200B;
Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.
&#x200B;
I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online
&#x200B;
it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?
&#x200B;
I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?
&#x200B;
Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?
&#x200B;
do indian people live in denial?
&#x200B;
or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?
&#x200B;
the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay
&#x200B;
I just don't get it
&#x200B;
what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?
I'd like to know what you guys think :)
&#x200B;
edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong. 
Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics, not always, of course, i'm not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality, but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience.
I hope i didn't offend anyone because i am genuinely interested in this, i like indian food, folklore, art and philosophy i am personally inclined to buddhism :) ",2020-04-20 13:13:31

From what I know, the drug has side-effects and it's efficacy has been contested in several clinical trials. The article mentions that the initial plan of testing 50,000 people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study.
As a layman, I had the following questions:
- What are the possible side-effects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions?
- Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions (quality of water, sanitation etc.), is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely? What implications does it have for the results of the experiment, even if it's carried out as planned? (Link to study for this claim [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141369/))
- Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past? From what I know, such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale.
- Thoughts about notion of informed consent for this study under these conditions?

It's outrageous to ask for help this often but we are hopeless in this situation as I lost my job and there's no income source left. We are trying to sell our land so that the money will be helpful to us but due to the lockdown which is almost like the second demonatization the economy is down.

I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.
I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.
Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!
I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!
I also tried and opened a case with resolver, wrote to their social media channels including Twitter, nowhere could I get any help.
My question is, what is the next better place could I open a case / get assistance from?",2020-04-19 19:10:34

> 
> During January 26âFebruary 10, 2020, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters. The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation.

r/COVID19 post: https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g3sgcf/covid19_outbreak_associated_with_air_conditioning/
Personally I think we need to give importance to the fact that there are summer viruses and winter viruses and they need different combinations of temperature+humidity.
Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/transmission/
> Humidity (best if between 50% and 80%)
> 
> ""It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane"" [source] Relative humidity (RH, or Saturation Ratio: the state of vapor equilibrium in room air) affects all infectious droplets with respiratory viruses, independent of their source (respiratory tract or aerosolized from any fluid) and location (in air or settled on surfaces). Relative humidity therefore affects all transmission ways but has the most pronounced effect on airborne transmission. [source]
> 
> ""Measurements of indoor humidities in 40 residential apartments in New York (19) and in 6 high-quality commercial buildings in the Midwest (20) showed indoor vapor pressure of below 10 mb or indoor RH of below 24% in the winter"" [source]
> 
> Experiments conducted in a study indicated ""a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH (20â50%), while the stability of summer or all-year viruses enhanced at higher RH (80%)"" [source]
Therefore, while our population size, education/awareness and density are strong disadvantages to us, maybe there is some advantage to be had if we **stop using air-conditioning entirely for the duration of the pandemic wherever possible**. 
This is speculation, but I believe it merits proper investigation.",2020-04-20 2:48:20

As far as I know, the janata curfew was voluntary and long back. On April 17, the lockdown and social-distancing was in full effect. But these folks are phrasing it on wiki so damn casually. As if the lockdown translates to janata curfew for VIPs.

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.
A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 
Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.
>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.
>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).
>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?
>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.
>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!
So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 
Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   
I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing
>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.
She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.
Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 
>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.
>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.
>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.
>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.
â
>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.
>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.
â

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.
Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.
As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.

Its called Syndicate.
In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.
After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.
Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]
Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.
Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",2020-04-19 22:52:34
What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g43omc/what_ht_wouldnt_publish_the_folly_and_vanity_of/,3.0,Policy/Economy,18.0,g43omc,bob_semple_,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)
Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  
*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 
In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhiâs Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: âWhy is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capitalâs catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?â
In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores âon a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhiâs pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the peopleâs good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.â
The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishoreâs article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firmâs previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their executionÂ  âupon the removal of  âobstaclesâ like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practicesâ. The firmâs past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting âan innate disrespect for the  citizenâ.
In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:
âThe biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs ElysÃ©es? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: âIt brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayerâs expense.â
Kishoreâs essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.
In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.

The prime ministerâs own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone â the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldnât quite do  for Narendra Modi.
To my mind, the Modi governmentâs redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  rulerâs immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean BÃ©del-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaulâs essay â[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)â).
Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  
As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why canât the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme â estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting â be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?
Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money â not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year â probably longer â before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.
In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice â sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.
*Postscript: While spiking this particular article, the* Hindustan Times  *left open the possibility of my continuing to write on other (and  presumably from the paperâs point of view safer) subjects. I have  however chosen to discontinue my column in the newspaper.*",2020-04-19 21:07:38

Alternative credit score & Automating the Entire process to reduce the Turn around time of loans into seconds
I want to solve this problems 
- In India, Just 35 millions pay Income tax out of 130 millions. Here credit underwriting model uses credit bureau data, Bank statements, Income tax returns.  So, 97% people are not accessed to formal credit. Still they borrow from the loan mafia & they charge exorbitant interest rates. There is need for alternative credit assessment, by using smartphone data & using social security numbers. 
- The Turn around time for the loans is 7 days to 3 Months. While the world battles issues centering around data privacy and consent, the Account Aggregator & Indian stack will allow both individuals and businesses to share their financial data in digital form with third parties in a safe manner. 
- Credit Risk - Risky Business 
 
Predicting the risk of customer credit default. How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. 
Unlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer. By applying advances in machine learning we can able to radically outperform traditional scorecards in both consumer and small business lending. 
By building models on more than simple default, and focusing on such outcomes as profitability and customer lifetime value, we allow you to fully leverage artificial intelligence to increase your lending performance. 
- Ample computing power and digital data are the fuel for machine learning, of course. The more data and the more iterations the algorithmic engine goes through, the better its output gets. Data scientists come up with probabilistic prediction models for specific actions, and then the algorithm churns through loads of data to produce better decisions in real time with every iteration. These prediction models become the basis for most business decisions.
- we applied for Account aggregator license from Reserve bank of India, we get all public data like Banking, Mutual funds, insurance etc. we are in the process building the consortium to share non financial data.
- By Automating the entire process &  building the algorithms using supervised learning, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, Experimenting & building software stack. I hope we can solve this problem. 
- current credit bureau has many flaws like their algorithm is  blatantly opaque, they donât use real time data, their business model itself skeptical. 
- So, we want to start a platform which can adds value to the both lenders & borrowers.
- We are looking for AI, ML engineers, data scientists who can build probabilistic models, blockchain enthusiasts,Front end designers for building the application & app.

India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/,123.0,Non-Political,220.0,g3mehq,kullky_2020,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.
You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?
I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.
What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?
Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",2020-04-19 1:30:47

So my father has an essential store and he gets this message on whatsapp saying that govt has launched a website to register your company as Suraksha Store so that they can get govt benefits.
Website: [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (very believable domain for the average non tech guy)
Here is what made me suspicious:
1. The website didn't open for me as I had high-security settings for chrome (ERR: Too many redirects)
2. No mention of website in any news
3. Powered by SafeJob at the end which is a private company
4. Copyright to suraksha circle (i.e. the circle that GOI has asked us to make where people will stand)
5. After filling the form, it asked us to get a certificate so that we can get approved faster and that certification needs us to login to their website [safejob.in](https://safejob.in) where we need to create account and do a suraksha certificate course
6. The course is a video where they explain how to make your store a suraksha store and then asks a basic quiz (which is a good deed they're doing acc. to me)
Here are my findings:
1. Terminal command I used:-  whois  [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (Only for tech guys)
2. The domain is being bought by Vineet Tiwari of Safeducate
3. There was no information that I could find linked to GOI
4. I checked socials of both safejob and safeducate (none of them have posted about it)
5. On website of safeducate, it says Ministry of rural development  but on surakshastore, it's ministry of home affairs (This might be against my hypothesis)

Do you guys have questions for your OBGYNS that they do not have time for? I'm an OBGYN and I have the answers,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3pod7/do_you_guys_have_questions_for_your_obgyns_that/,5.0,Science/Technology,51.0,g3pod7,meanerthanaverage,"Hey Guys,
As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.
Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.
This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs
This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.
I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.
YOU are in charge of your body.

I am designing a software to help physios save some time, while impacting their income positively. I need some data for that. Please help me with some questions. The following questions are not specific to your practice, but generally about physiotherapy in India.
 
Generally, how many sessions does a person need for his rehab?
What % of patients leave their therapy incomplete?
What would be the reasons for a patient to leave their therapy incomplete?
Generally how much more do home visits cost as compared to patient visiting the clinic?
Do physiotherapy patients have a waiting time at clinic? If yes, what would be the approximate time that patients need to wait for?
What other challenges do patients face in regards to their physiotherapy?
What are the challenges that physios face in their day to day business operations?
How often do physios have to work with multiple patients at one time?
How often do physios have to stretch their schedules/work hours because of excess patients?
How often do physios themselves face occupational hazards like back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain due to manual work or physically demanding sessions?
How many maximum sessions can an average physiotherapist do in a month? I am trying to understand the income ceiling of an average physio.
What are the fixed expenses per month of an average physio?
What are the ways that an average physio uses to cross the monthly income ceiling?",2020-04-19 17:25:28

India is a stark contrast compared the USA from what I've seen, but that has only made me want to travel there even more. I had some burning questions I would love some answers to. Besides some YouTubers and books, it can be hard to get some valuable information about traveling to India, as most Americans are baffled at the thought of me VOLUNTARILY wanting to go to India, and only think of it as a dirty and extremely poor 3rd world country without even researching the country.
1. Would you recommend doing a guided tour (even though they can be cheesy and touristic at times) for my first time in India or would it be doable to solo travel or travel with a few friends? I've heard India can be very overwhelming for foreigners at first, but I wanted to know your thoughts.
2. What are some safety tips that are actually TRUE and not stereotypical. I've heard about the poor water quality, Delhi belly (caution against street food), beggars, so HOT, not to walk outside at night, scammers on the street, dirty, filled with pollution, etc. but I want to know if there is any truth to any of this and what I can do to have a great experience.
3. What cities (and sights) would you most recommend for a first-timer in India if I were to travel there for 7-10 days? Where can I find the busiest and most chaotic streets in India (as this fascinates me, as in the USA the roads are very organized). What kind of budget would I need for 7-10 days?
4. Also just out of curiosity, what stereotypes of India or Indian people would you wish to disappear as they are not true?
5. What else can I do to best prepare for a trip to India?

This article is replete with half-truths and as an Indian who has read the law being talked about in this article, you need to understand the situation in bit more detail. But first, hereâs a link to the law, if you care to read it on your own: [http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/370\_2019\_LS\_Eng.pdf](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/370_2019_LS_Eng.pdf)
Letâs start,
Hereâs what the author claims:
>*On December 11, Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs Hindu-nationalist government had passed its Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which gave immigrants from three neighboring countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) a path to citizenship on one condition: that they were not Muslim.*
This a half-truth. Yes, the law fast tracks the naturalization process for persecuted minorities belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan. It enables them to be granted citizenship in six years instead of 12 and is valid only if these minorities entered into India on or before the 31st December 2014. For those who donât belong to the above mentioned persecuted category, you will have to go the normal route which is Citizenship by Naturalisation.
It is a well-known fact that minorities in predominantly Muslim populations are often persecuted and this is especially true for countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.
**If you donât believe me then here are some links,**
**The recent terrorist attack in Kabul on a Sikh Gurudwara is only the latest happening in a string of many such in the past.**[https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/afghan-sikhs-tired-of-living-in-afghanistan-demand-probe-into-isis-attack-on-kabul-gurudwara/story/399429.html](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/afghan-sikhs-tired-of-living-in-afghanistan-demand-probe-into-isis-attack-on-kabul-gurudwara/story/399429.html)
**Hereâs a report by BBC on the persecution of Christians in Pakistan:**[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35910331](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35910331)
**And, hereâs one by BBC talking about the persecution of Hindus in Pakistan:**[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34645370](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34645370)
Itâs also important to remember that the partition of India was done because the Indian Muslim League wanted a separate state for Muslims in India. Owing to this, it doesnât make any sense to fast-track any citizenship claim from Muslims in Pakistan or Bangladesh (formerly East-Pakistan), and Afghanistan. Yet, they are free to apply through regular channels.
Here is one such example: [https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/newsindia/amidst-anti-caa-protests-pakistani-woman-granted-indian-citizenship-in-jandk/ar-BBYj9Jh](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/newsindia/amidst-anti-caa-protests-pakistani-woman-granted-indian-citizenship-in-jandk/ar-BBYj9Jh)
Also, former Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh belonging to the Congress party, a man for whom I have immense respect, asked the then NDA government in 2003 to bring in the same CAA.
The law that CAA works in tandem with is NRC(National Register of Citizens). NRC has not been drafted yet and it remains to be seen how the government will go about it. Also, Illegal immigration is a big problem for an already poor country like India. If you want to get a better idea about how poor India is then understand thisâââIndiaâs GDP per capita was 2,009.98 USD in 2018 compared to USAâs 62,794.59 USD in the same year.
Dubious claim number 2:
>*In August, I received a letter from the Home Ministry threatening me with the cancellation of my citizenship status. Then, in November, an Indian news site leaked what the government was planning to do. Within hours, the Home Ministryâs spokesperson was on Twitter, canceling my citizenship before I had been officially informed. In one stroke, Modiâs government cut me off from the country I had written and thought about my whole life, and where all the people I had grown up with still lived.*
The author is a British citizen and OCI is not citizenship. Itâs more like a permanent Visa that grants permits to foreign citizens of Indian descent to work and live in India.

The law that CAA works in tandem with is NRC(National Register of Citizens). The law has not been drafted yet and it remains to be seen how the government will go about it. the one implemented in the state of Assam at the moment is whole another cesspool and came into effect on 1st March 1950. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National\_Register\_of\_Citizens\_for\_Assam#Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens_for_Assam#Background)
I generally like Aatish Taseerâs work and yes the Modi government should not have revoked his OCI. This is in no way should be taken as my liking for the governmentâs brazen policy decisions and itâs utter failure when it comes to dealing with the countryâs economic reforms or its handling of certain criticisms from the press. But, this article in the Atlantic stoops too low to gain eyeballs.",2020-04-20 5:09:44

Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3lncu/horlics_chocolate_powder_vs_cadbury_cocoa_powder/,23.0,Food,17.0,g3lncu,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 
Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

"TIL that in UP and Bihar, almost six out of ten deaths were not registered in the death statistics (based on the latest available CRS data from 2017)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3n6wq/til_that_in_up_and_bihar_almost_six_out_of_ten/,0.0,Coronavirus,11.0,g3n6wq,jai_ho_kick,"  
TL;DR, India lacks systematic registration of deaths even in the absence of the current pandemic. It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.

  
There have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India's success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.

Today, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).

I was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):

1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).
2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.

Moreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The ""cause of death"" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))

Given these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. 

These are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths.",2020-04-19 2:34:45

My sincere thought was and is still that - whatever desk jobs can be done through Work from home(WFH) should be done in that way without any loosening of screws - which the govt seems to be doing now. 

Especially for IT sector employees who are working from home and thereby not putting undue stress on a societal level even inadvertently - on their fellow colleagues, office staff, their own health, their near ones health and the greater population - especially for  them who are actually equipped to do WFH , why the rush to loosen up everything now as if after 20th April, Covid19 would magically disappear.

IFFâs Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paperâs analysis of the partnership through the lens of whatâs good, possible risks and the projectâs relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.


Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the worldâs two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.


Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.


To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required. Â Similar to Singaporeâs *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFFâs Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every userâs device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance peopleâs privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu appâs own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their âclose proximityâ interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individualâs phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other personâs phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.


One of the large outcomes of the coronavirusâ impact in relation to peopleâs increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on peopleâs movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect peopleâs fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to peopleâs personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations. Â Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the projectâs first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions. Â Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.


It is important to highlight that Indiaâs Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFFâs submission will address the whitepaper/consultationâs interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.

The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.

The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

Only thing which is good is the soundtrack.
A complete disappointment.

Sino-Indian Relationship post COVID-19 (DISCUSSION).,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3kqnp/sinoindian_relationship_post_covid19_discussion/,4.0,Policy/Economy,11.0,g3kqnp,AdmiralSP,"Note: This it a self post and NOT VERIFIED NEWS.
I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.

Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*",2020-04-18 21:17:29

  So this is about my brother who is an assistant manager in a PSU (public sector undertaking).Its a good secure job but there is a strong  chance  that this company might be privatised within 10 years.After passing out from his college my brother  was placed in an IT Company but he didn't  take that  up  because he wanted a secure govt. job.His CGPA is 8.2 and gre score  is 334 so he is very sure he will  get admission to a tier 1 university.   

His first problem is that he is a EC (electronics and communication)graduate and doesn't have much knowledge of computer science and doesn't have any significant coding experience.The only  language he knows is C++.  So he is concerned whether he will be able to cope up acdemically.
 The second (possible) obstacle is his age.He is almost 30 years old now and by the time he will have completed his MS he will be 32.Will this be a problem in getting a job in the US?( he doesn't want a job in India)
  
Our third concern is the current scenario in US with the coronavirus and possible  changes to the H1b visa process.Will this affect his chances  ?  
.Is it worth risking a secure  job for this opportunity?is it feasible?",2020-04-19 7:34:22

Why is the Modified Media continuously playing the same propaganda themes again and again? It is by design not by chance. Here are some thoughts on this,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g318gs/why_is_the_modified_media_continuously_playing/,7.0,Politics,54.0,g318gs,jatadharius,"First of all  It's a feature not a bug. And is being consistently working towards its goal.

The way media is behaving in last few years, it seems we are inching more and more towards a totalitarian form of government. The idea that media can be effectively used to control and sway public sentiments is not new. One of the earliest major successes stories when the media was used in this manner comes from Nazi Germany. I will quote some relevant paragraphs from [Mein Kampf](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54153/page/n3/mode/2up) (particularly Chapter 6 War Propaganda) which seems to be like the cookbook for our present incumbents.

Second it is not dumb. In case you are wondering that the ""intellectual level"" of the media has dropped, it is talking to the masses who are not ""intellectual"". It is by design that the content has been ""dumbed down""

> To whom should  propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or to the less educated masses? 

> It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses. 

> What the intelligentsia â or those who today unfortunately 
often go by that name â what they need is not propaganda but scientific instruction. The content of propaganda is not science  any more than the object represented in a poster is art.

> All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. 

> It is not the purpose of propaganda to provide a series of thrills with a view to pleasing these blase gentry. Its chief function is to convince the masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be given time in order that they may absorb information; and only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd. 


About the persistence of the themes, the Hindu-Muslim divide, the ""other"",

> Any variation must not alter the main theme of the propaganda, but must always emphasize the same point. The slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end the stress must always be laid on the slogan itself. In this way alone can propaganda be consistent and dynamic in its effects. 

> Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly, with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then we shall be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results that such a persistent policy secures. The success of any advertisement, whether of a business or a political nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance with which it is employed.

Apart from the negatives( communalism ) , even some credible media organisations ( Theprint , Lallantop) etc. are praising his way of handling corona pandemic and also his foresightedness in making policies to make U.P a industrial powerhouse .


Is it a hogwash by Sanghi media to project Yogi as an alternative to Modi or the PR is because of the TRP and clickbaits  which yogi Adityanath gives to news channels and online portals.
Ajay bisht is not a very media friendly person and has gone to the extent of filing FIRs and jailing them, then why a section of media is bootlicking him is beyond my understanding.

He spent his last days fasting for a clean Ganga in 2018. He died after 112 days.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prof. G. D. Agarwal, alma mater IIT Roorkee UC Berkeley, died from a fast-unto-death to protest against environmentally destructive projects on Ganga and Bhagirathi .

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/12/indian-environmental-activist-fasts-death-over-fate-indias-ganges-river/
He was extremely vocal against illegal river sand mining.
Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 
With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.
I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.
Why do you think mainstream media wants us to focus on Timur ?
Shame on each and every Indian for not knowing about him and his life struggle when he was alive and fighting on our behalf.",2020-04-20 23:00:06

Some use this as a tactic for extorting money from helpless and desperate victims. But the others seemingly do it for the following or the pleasure of having many men following them because it's an outlet for their pent up aggression from being starved of sex or contact with women

"Is it only the common people who have to abide by the rules, boundaries and whatever......",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4n0hx/is_it_only_the_common_people_who_have_to_abide_by/,42.0,Non-Political,138.0,g4n0hx,wollowitzz,"First of all, I have utmost respect for the people who put forth the safety of others before their own, and are sincerely standing their grounds to do whatever little or more they can do to be of help for anybody not only in the current situation but anytime.
Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.
Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 
After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.
Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.
After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.
TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.
Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad's healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.",2020-04-20 19:06:40

Price of testing kits should be based on income.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4lkpv/price_of_testing_kits_should_be_based_on_income/,18.0,Coronavirus,4.0,g4lkpv,I_can_believe_that,"Nearly, 92% female and 82% male workers in India earn earn less than 10,000 per month, since most of them canât afford to pay for test kits all government testing labs should be reserved for people of households with income below 10k pm, they should be tested for free. 
People from households with income more than 10,000 per month have to pay some amounts (with some subsidies depending on income) for testing and should be tested at private labs only.
People in the bracket 10,000 pm to 20,000 pm arenât exactly well-off either they should pay â¹500 per test.
People in the bracket 20,000 -50,000 can pay in 1000s, therefore, they should pay â¹2,500 per test.
People in the bracket 50,000 - 100,000 are pretty well off and should pay â¹4,500 per test.
People earning above â¹1 lakh per month should pay â¹5,000 per test. 
And people earning above â¹2 lakh per month should pay â¹6,500 per test.
The point of well earning people paying more is that theyâd be able to fund Indian based manufacturers to boost their production of rapid-testing kits and also the number of private labs. Government bidding test kits from foreign countries should have separate budget, as usual. 
As of now, almost all Indian based companies are planning to keep the cost below â¹2,000
Assuming weâve got 650,000 test kits from China 3 days ago with some stocks and  two of our local companies HLL and Voxtur that have begun production and expect to produce 100,000 by the end of the week. With more fundings they should be able to meet or even surpass the foreign bought rapid test kits in production units.

&#x200B;
So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).
Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.
&#x200B;
Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.
&#x200B;
I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?
&#x200B;
Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.

Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.
&#x200B;
I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online
&#x200B;
it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?
&#x200B;
I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?
&#x200B;
Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?
&#x200B;
do indian people live in denial?
&#x200B;
or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?
&#x200B;
the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay
&#x200B;
I just don't get it
&#x200B;
what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?
I'd like to know what you guys think :)
&#x200B;
edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong. 
Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics, not always, of course, i'm not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality, but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience.
I hope i didn't offend anyone because i am genuinely interested in this, i like indian food, folklore, art and philosophy i am personally inclined to buddhism :) ",2020-04-20 13:13:31

"[NSFW maybe] What was always ubiquitous in schools, but people don't like to talk about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4919v/nsfw_maybe_what_was_always_ubiquitous_in_schools/,15.0,AskIndia,38.0,g4919v,ainy_jaffri,"I wanted to say some memories from early school. Nothing shocking, just normal things, thoughts ... 
What do you make of your frame-of-mind when you used to go to school (as in before class 9)? Sometimes, talking to people in my college or other places, I feel that they've forgotten our point of view from even the recent past. And everyone just accepts that kids are naive in one way. Everything's normal if we just accept that we're worse today than how we used to be when we were that little.
So is it right? Whatever age you are now, you probably remember having choice when you were half your age, don't you? If you're a bigger sibling or a parent reading this, do you wory that you can't do enough for the kids?
You may have gone to a good school, or not at all -- who knows really what is worse; but school like I remember was never a place where I went to study good things like math and science and geography. Everyday we play-acted the Lord of the Flies.
These thoughts/memories are not in any order. I'm just writing them as I remember off the top of my head ...
In your experience, when did you first notice developing hierarchies in schools (and not caused by the administration directly)? My earliest memory is from when I was in class 4 or 5. There was in my class one student who was a repeater, so he was older and taller than the rest us. All the other boys looked up to him. My parents never gave me a phone or a computer even until much later, and I was not bright either, so I was impressed by anyone that seemed to have a clue. In this class and being in the cool-only group, we played cricket and football in break time and other time we sniffed dendrite and whitener and the obvious things you can guess, while the adults had no clue or didn't care what went on in the last benches. I learned also that I could make the best grades in class easily when I focused my mind, which wasn't easy.
Did the faculty keep the rooms clean? Many times in empty classrooms there was left in one corner or inside a desk, empty pepsi/fanta-type bottles into which someone had ejaculated. This kind of usual stuff, like also the fan blades being bent etc., happened from mid-school to maybe class 8. There's some version of this everywhere. This one I've only heard from others: Some guy peed in (or spat in) someone's waterbottle and put it back in the victim's school bag.
Do you agree with the notion that some cousin of racism has always been present in our schools, even from the first day? I don't remember that far back, but as far as I can, I call it by that name. Like if we can think of the worst racist bigot in politics, and multiply that by 10, there's the equivalent of the classmates I had growing up. haha! It's funny saying it that way. It's cute now that we get outraged when some public personality lets out a distasteful opinion. I hate it too, but I wish we stopped acting surprised. From what I remember, growing up in our schools: people's skin colour, weight, speech impediment, financial status, any disability was always fair game. And the teacher's were not innocent. They used racial slur's all the time, and strangely, there were some teachers who were plain cruel. People who come straight out of a horror movie. Umm ... it just seemed odd that for no reason at all, a teacher would twist someone's surname into something nasty-sounding, or pull a sardar joke out of his ass while waiting for the bell to ring. 
We would haze very badly, anyone who is gay. I was so dumb that I thought for sure that gay means something bad (because of a Aamir Khan movie I saw). In school there was only one person who explicitly identified in this way. I never got a chance to say sorry. Even when that person would cry we would come again the next day and call him names and attach his name with some other guy and bully. Beats me that we got away with this.
In class 6 or 7, I think, sometimes our subject teacher was absent. Other teachers started to pop-in from time-to-time to check and punish anyone that was out seat. Students invented were weird ways to pass the boredom, like one that went like this. Because we couldn't go anywhere, the ""dare"" part of the truth-or-dare game was removed and the truth-teller had to now compulsorily pick from one of the options. The only point was to humiliate a new guy by making him say stupid shit. Always it's the same question: whose dick would you suck? The older players pressured the new guy until he said some other guy's name. Then the older players say something like ""but why not this other one? what's wrong with this color?"" Then the new seemingly straight guy tries to clarify and digs his own grave, while the rest egg him on. Kinda weird we came up with this prank. Freud would've something to say about this.
One girl from where I worked told me this. In elementary grade, her best friend (girl) had facial hair slightly excess. Her conservative parents ""sent her to school to study and not focus on fashion."" One day her classmates teamed up and secretly drew a face with large moustache with chalk and wrote her name on blackboard. Everyone saw this and laughed at her and she cried. This happened in front of the teacher and the full class (they had some loadshedding situation that allowed opportunity for this particular prank). After this incident she never went back to that school. Don't worry, she's still alive. She felt very hurt and convinced her parents, then they pulled strings to tranfer her to different school. Maybe she was holding her depression for long time and what was funny for others was unbearably hurtful. (unrelated, but have you seen that funny video of the penis cat permanent marker prank on the teacher?)
This is my memory from class 5 or 6. I still feel angry if I think of it. I don't care now I guess. I had got the feeling that a gym teacher was following me around in school. He was a grey haired stoutish guy who also taught karate or something to students. It was not a overt ""tag you're it"" kind of following. That's why I never told anyone because it's very strange and I think no one will believe me. I just saw this asshole appear out of nowhere like right beside me talking to another teacher or near the door or any entrance and talking to another teacher right at the moment I was walking past it. Every morning after chapel when we lined up to go back to class, he seemed to somehow end up in line ahead or behind from me either immediately or there was one or two students between us. I didn't know who to complain to or what I will say in the complain. He was well-respected in school as he was involved whenever charity event or activity happened. He didn't make eye contact or anything but you have no idea what that felt like when suddenly I saw him crossing my classroom on any days for no reason. This creepy behaviour was making me depressed day by day. After class 6, the classes were in different building in different location in the city. I was relieved to never have to see this creep again. Now that I'm in college, even though I'm living in different city, I wish I meet him randomly on the street sometime because I'll kick the living shit out of him.
My classmates and I, had heard of planchettes and that stuff for the first time in class 7. We are very dense, especially I. Anyway, there was this fainting technique/trend whatever-it's-called that we had heard recently. A person had to perform a few moves (I don't think it's necessary that I list our version here) and this would cause them to pass-out (probably due to lack of oxygen in the brain or something). One of my friends volunteered or maybe we evilly coaxed him into it. That evening, the seven of us went to a friend's home, to test if the fainting thing actually works. In the friend's room, it was now night. We stood surrounding him just far enough that he wouldn't fall and break his neck and die (but really we were not paying attention because we doubted it would even work). On the third attempt he suddenly started walking and jumped from the top of a staircase straight to the bottom. The rest of us almost shit our pants, and for a few seconds we froze instead of running to help our friend. Only I went to check the corpse, but when I reached the landing, our friend had begun to get up on his own. He had this cool new gash above his eye and blood dripping, and just stared at me wondering why we were staring back at him! like we'd seen a ghost! He had no memory of jumping or fainting or the pain of the forehead splitting. We went together the six of us to hospital (one of the guys called a taxi and went home, I thought he literally shat himself), and got his forehead stitched up.

Personally I think we need to give importance to the fact that there are summer viruses and winter viruses and they need different combinations of temperature+humidity.
Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/transmission/
> Humidity (best if between 50% and 80%)
> 
> ""It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane"" [source] Relative humidity (RH, or Saturation Ratio: the state of vapor equilibrium in room air) affects all infectious droplets with respiratory viruses, independent of their source (respiratory tract or aerosolized from any fluid) and location (in air or settled on surfaces). Relative humidity therefore affects all transmission ways but has the most pronounced effect on airborne transmission. [source]
> 
> ""Measurements of indoor humidities in 40 residential apartments in New York (19) and in 6 high-quality commercial buildings in the Midwest (20) showed indoor vapor pressure of below 10 mb or indoor RH of below 24% in the winter"" [source]
> 
> Experiments conducted in a study indicated ""a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH (20â50%), while the stability of summer or all-year viruses enhanced at higher RH (80%)"" [source]
Therefore, while our population size, education/awareness and density are strong disadvantages to us, **maybe** there is some advantage to be had if we **stop using air-conditioning entirely for the duration of the pandemic wherever possible**. 
This is speculation, but I believe **it merits proper investigation**.

Alternative credit score & Automating the Entire process to reduce the Turn around time of loans into seconds
I want to solve this problems 
- In India, Just 35 millions pay Income tax out of 130 millions. Here credit underwriting model uses credit bureau data, Bank statements, Income tax returns.  So, 97% people are not accessed to formal credit. Still they borrow from the loan mafia & they charge exorbitant interest rates. There is need for alternative credit assessment, by using smartphone data & using social security numbers. 
- The Turn around time for the loans is 7 days to 3 Months. While the world battles issues centering around data privacy and consent, the Account Aggregator & Indian stack will allow both individuals and businesses to share their financial data in digital form with third parties in a safe manner. 
- Credit Risk - Risky Business 
 
Predicting the risk of customer credit default. How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. 
Unlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer. By applying advances in machine learning we can able to radically outperform traditional scorecards in both consumer and small business lending. 
By building models on more than simple default, and focusing on such outcomes as profitability and customer lifetime value, we allow you to fully leverage artificial intelligence to increase your lending performance. 
- Ample computing power and digital data are the fuel for machine learning, of course. The more data and the more iterations the algorithmic engine goes through, the better its output gets. Data scientists come up with probabilistic prediction models for specific actions, and then the algorithm churns through loads of data to produce better decisions in real time with every iteration. These prediction models become the basis for most business decisions.
- we applied for Account aggregator license from Reserve bank of India, we get all public data like Banking, Mutual funds, insurance etc. we are in the process building the consortium to share non financial data.
- By Automating the entire process &  building the algorithms using supervised learning, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, Experimenting & building software stack. I hope we can solve this problem. 
- current credit bureau has many flaws like their algorithm is  blatantly opaque, they donât use real time data, their business model itself skeptical. 
- So, we want to start a platform which can adds value to the both lenders & borrowers.
- We are looking for AI, ML engineers, data scientists who can build probabilistic models, blockchain enthusiasts,Front end designers for building the application & app.

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.
A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 
Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.
>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.
>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).
>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?
>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.
>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!
So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 
Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing
>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.
She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.
Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 
>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.
>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.
>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.
>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.
>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.
â
>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.
>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.
Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.
As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.

Its called Syndicate.
In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.
After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.
Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]
Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.
Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",2020-04-19 22:52:34

What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g43omc/what_ht_wouldnt_publish_the_folly_and_vanity_of/,3.0,Policy/Economy,17.0,g43omc,bob_semple_,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)
Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  
*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 
In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhiâs Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: âWhy is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capitalâs catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?â
In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores âon a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhiâs pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the peopleâs good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.â
The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishoreâs article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firmâs previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their executionÂ  âupon the removal of  âobstaclesâ like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practicesâ. The firmâs past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting âan innate disrespect for the  citizenâ.
In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:
âThe biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs ElysÃ©es? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: âIt brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayerâs expense.â
Kishoreâs essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.
In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.
Also read: [In Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Central Vista Project Should Be Reviewed](https://thewire.in/urban/covid-19-central-vista-project-new-delhi)
The prime ministerâs own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone â the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldnât quite do  for Narendra Modi.
To my mind, the Modi governmentâs redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  rulerâs immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean BÃ©del-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaulâs essay â[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)â).
Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  
As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why canât the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme â estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting â be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?
Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money â not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year â probably longer â before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.
In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice â sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.

Scamming people to sign up to their platform using the name of SURAKSHA STORE ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3z60v/scamming_people_to_sign_up_to_their_platform/,1.0,Coronavirus,9.0,g3z60v,regover,"Hi guys,
So my father has an essential store and he gets this message on whatsapp saying that govt has launched a website to register your company as Suraksha Store so that they can get govt benefits.
Website: [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (very believable domain for the average non tech guy)
Here is what made me suspicious:
1. The website didn't open for me as I had high-security settings for chrome (ERR: Too many redirects)
2. No mention of website in any news
3. Powered by SafeJob at the end which is a private company
4. Copyright to suraksha circle (i.e. the circle that GOI has asked us to make where people will stand)
5. After filling the form, it asked us to get a certificate so that we can get approved faster and that certification needs us to login to their website [safejob.in](https://safejob.in) where we need to create account and do a suraksha certificate course
6. The course is a video where they explain how to make your store a suraksha store and then asks a basic quiz (which is a good deed they're doing acc. to me)
Here are my findings:
1. Terminal command I used:-  whois  [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (Only for tech guys)
2. The domain is being bought by Vineet Tiwari of Safeducate
3. There was no information that I could find linked to GOI
4. I checked socials of both safejob and safeducate (none of them have posted about it)
5. On website of safeducate, it says Ministry of rural development  but on surakshastore, it's ministry of home affairs (This might be against my hypothesis)
Link of whois result: [https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com](https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com&recaptchaResponse=03AHaCkAYKFQoubZUr1si98nAJnDn0VM5x5Z43VMMjUoyLO1OfY6lZsxqf1KTMRFuBsIi-l1TfdDBlHZ8lnGsQITNwXSt0vzgA9qzvXb0vT-855S7tRKA89dveP9obUN1_-4h7_BMwDaHKbO10AhbG4UDY6cgIKuESpGtZuoB0ButrjvBGiUqvDeaZ0rheIJiXAfst1Ur0jfVO2kLAyWXtK06gIqJ91T5GNjTbLLFxLxiJDlMY_Xw_Z13ms4xI2exVKuKWLsEF6CxdGASDWCqJFs6ZRmhX3i32QIYVxC0Q5n-p1qHW8r1-Q0KfTP3SML-_LYUisjC8ov5kzPWswqFk2fP3l_p5gNwCPxZ57_NWY6SPL4NO1zck4RvLec_PsHxBc3siRu0R1RArgdRwKA3YzlcyD_kvPxKpcQ)

Although I highly think this is a scam, I would want to ask you guys if you think otherwise and if you also find that this website is a scam, please notify your Whatsapp groups. (Lies circulate through WhatsApp, so let the truth tackle it there itself)
I'm open to any sources that prove that this is not a scam. If it is a scam, then you have to be the lowest of scums to make profit in these times scamming people.

I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.
I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.
Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!
I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!
I also tried and opened a case with resolver, wrote to their social media channels including Twitter, nowhere could I get any help.
My question is, what is the next better place could I open a case / get assistance from?",2020-04-19 19:10:34

India is a stark contrast compared the USA from what I've seen, but that has only made me want to travel there even more. I had some burning questions I would love some answers to. Besides some YouTubers and books, it can be hard to get some valuable information about traveling to India, as most Americans are baffled at the thought of me VOLUNTARILY wanting to go to India, and only think of it as a dirty and extremely poor 3rd world country without even researching the country.
1. Would you recommend doing a guided tour (even though they can be cheesy and touristic at times) for my first time in India or would it be doable to solo travel or travel with a few friends? I've heard India can be very overwhelming for foreigners at first, but I wanted to know your thoughts.
2. What are some safety tips that are actually TRUE and not stereotypical. I've heard about the poor water quality, Delhi belly (caution against street food), beggars, so HOT, not to walk outside at night, scammers on the street, dirty, filled with pollution, etc. but I want to know if there is any truth to any of this and what I can do to have a great experience.
3. What cities (and sights) would you most recommend for a first-timer in India if I were to travel there for 7-10 days? Where can I find the busiest and most chaotic streets in India (as this fascinates me, as in the USA the roads are very organized). What kind of budget would I need for 7-10 days?
4. Also just out of curiosity, what stereotypes of India or Indian people would you wish to disappear as they are not true?
5. What else can I do to best prepare for a trip to India?
Any information, suggestions, tips, or advice would be greatly appreciated!",2020-04-19 11:53:54

  So this is about my brother who is an assistant manager in a PSU (public sector undertaking).Its a good secure job but there is a strong  chance  that this company might be privatised within 10 years.After passing out from his college my brother  was placed in an IT Company but he didn't  take that  up  because he wanted a secure govt. job.His CGPA is 8.2 and gre score  is 334 so he is very sure he will  get admission to a tier 1 university.   
His first problem is that he is a EC (electronics and communication)graduate and doesn't have much knowledge of computer science and doesn't have any significant coding experience.The only  language he knows is C++.  So he is concerned whether he will be able to cope up acdemically.
 The second (possible) obstacle is his age.He is almost 30 years old now and by the time he will have completed his MS he will be 32.Will this be a problem in getting a job in the US?( he doesn't want a job in India)
  
Our third concern is the current scenario in US with the coronavirus and possible  changes to the H1b visa process.Will this affect his chances  ?  
.Is it worth risking a secure  job for this opportunity?is it feasible?",2020-04-19 7:34:22

My sincere thought was and is still that - whatever desk jobs can be done through Work from home(WFH) should be done in that way without any loosening of screws - which the govt seems to be doing now. 
Especially for IT sector employees who are working from home and thereby not putting undue stress on a societal level even inadvertently - on their fellow colleagues, office staff, their own health, their near ones health and the greater population - especially for  them who are actually equipped to do WFH , why the rush to loosen up everything now as if after 20th April, Covid19 would magically disappear.

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.
Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.
This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs
This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.
I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.
YOU are in charge of your body.

"TIL that in UP and Bihar, almost six out of ten deaths were not registered in the death statistics (based on the latest available CRS data from 2017)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3n6wq/til_that_in_up_and_bihar_almost_six_out_of_ten/,0.0,Coronavirus,9.0,g3n6wq,jai_ho_kick,"  
TL;DR, India lacks systematic registration of deaths even in the absence of the current pandemic. It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.
  
There have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India's success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.
Today, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).
I was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):
1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).
2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.
Moreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The ""cause of death"" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))
Given these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. 
These are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths.",2020-04-19 2:34:45

India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/,123.0,Non-Political,219.0,g3mehq,kullky_2020,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.
You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?
I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.
What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?
Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",2020-04-19 1:30:47
Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3lncu/horlics_chocolate_powder_vs_cadbury_cocoa_powder/,23.0,Food,18.0,g3lncu,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 
Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 
For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.
The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.
Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 
That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 
30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 
Lets go even deeper.
With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)
With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 
Lets go per serving now.
With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?
With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings
So I bought the cocoa.
You can make the comparison yourself:

So I heard about Asur from Reddit where op praises the show, so checked IMDb, it had a rating of 8.7 so I decided to give it a shot.
Watched it within 2 days and was completely disappointed .
The show is full of plot holes some of these are,
* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.
*Oxygen chamber having timer instead of an oximeter. Also the clock speed up when hostages are idle but works Normal when they're trying to kill eachother where oxygen consumption is increased.
You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.
The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.
The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.
Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.
China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.
Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.
Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?
Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?
Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.
Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.
Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.
In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.
I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.
I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

Mom being inherently biased against muslims. Help me change her views.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3fogm/mom_being_inherently_biased_against_muslims_help/,26.0,AskIndia,0.0,g3fogm,NewThrowaway543210,"To give it a bit of context (She stays with dad in a tier 3 city with no contact to anyone apart from work friends, I live in a tier 1 city because of job)
I recently had an argument with my Mom, about the role of muslims in the recent covid 19 spread in India. I said I'm not disagreeing that certain groups of the muslim community are solely responsible for a massive spike in infections, but the tone that you are implying means that you had a problem with muslims long before this covid infection started.
Upon hearing this, she went full defensive mode, saying muslims are responsible for all the wars with India and they are responsible for every atrocity in India. I asked how many muslims have you spoken to in your life ?  She said she knows about Pakistan and the wars and that is enough. She said they are ""abishwas jati""
Our argument heated up and now I'm here asking what do I do to change her opinion that all muslims aren't ""Pakistani"" and aren't out to destroy the world. Media doesn't portray muslim in good light and it has led to years of indoctrination with older people who have no other contact other than media. But I am not saying I am apologising for muslims. I am an atheist and consider all religions to be irrelevant, islam to be the most if I had to draw a priority chart.
&#x200B;
EDIT:  One more point, To make matters worse, when Italy was #1 in covid infections, I found she was googling, ""how many muslims are there in Italy"". It was both hilarious and sad that she drew causality vs correlation, though that argument would have failed as well as Italy is not a muslim majority country.",2020-04-18 15:45:50

IFFâs Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paperâs analysis of the partnership through the lens of whatâs good, possible risks and the projectâs relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.
Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the worldâs two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.
The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.
This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.
In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.
Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.
1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.
To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.
Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required. Â Similar to Singaporeâs *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFFâs Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every userâs device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance peopleâs privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu appâs own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.
Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their âclose proximityâ interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.
When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individualâs phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other personâs phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.
The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.
One of the large outcomes of the coronavirusâ impact in relation to peopleâs increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on peopleâs movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.
When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect peopleâs fundamental rights to informational privacy.
Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.
* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to peopleâs personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations. Â Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the projectâs first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions. Â Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.

It is important to highlight that Indiaâs Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFFâs submission will address the whitepaper/consultationâs interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

Need help regarding my career. Specifically MBA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g35581/need_help_regarding_my_career_specifically_mba/,22.0,AskIndia,10.0,g35581,para97k,"Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",2020-04-18 5:49:56

How much testing is enough testing ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g33qna/how_much_testing_is_enough_testing/,3.0,Coronavirus,10.0,g33qna,Deepfriedpakoda,"  
Every time someone mentions that the number of Covid cases are low in India, you are likely to meet the ""We aren't doing enough testing"" quote.   
When you consider the data point of ""tests per million"", you will see India faring quite bad but again most of the other countries aren't dealing with a huge population crisis or even the vastness of a country like ours.   
So don't you think no matter how many tests we conduct we are anyways going to fare lowly in that metric point ? So my question is why are we complaining about the low number of tests per million and is it actually a valid data point for us to ponder over ?   
Data Source : [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries)   
If you notice China which is our closest in terms of population has played with their numbers to an extent where no one knows whats real or whats not. So what metric can I look at and say ""Hey the govt is not doing that bad a job"" or ""Hey, it's a shit show out there""!

So what is the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test has three simple, unambiguous criterias:

* A film has to have at least two (named) women characters in it.

* These women characters at some point of the movie talk to each other.

* They talk about something other than men.

The test has it's inspiration (seemingly) in an 1929 essay by Virginia Woolf.

One of the larger samples tested in 2019 resulted in very few Hindi movies actually passing the same.

https://thelogicalindian.com/story-feed/awareness/bollywood-hindi-cinema-bechdel-test

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6Amqk0gSE

I'm not even sure how regional cinema fares in this.

Television all across the country seems like it will fail the same miserably.

While the test has no assurance about the *quality* of female representation in the said movie \ work of fiction - one small incentive is, **it's observed that movies who do meet the criteria are known to perform better financially, than those who don't.**

Why is the Modified Media continuously playing the same propaganda themes again and again? It is by design not by chance. Here are some thoughts on this,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g318gs/why_is_the_modified_media_continuously_playing/,7.0,Politics,59.0,g318gs,jatadharius,"First of all  It's a feature not a bug. And is being consistently working towards its goal.

The way media is behaving in last few years, it seems we are inching more and more towards a totalitarian form of government. The idea that media can be effectively used to control and sway public sentiments is not new. One of the earliest major successes stories when the media was used in this manner comes from Nazi Germany. I will quote some relevant paragraphs from [Mein Kampf](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54153/page/n3/mode/2up) (particularly Chapter 6 War Propaganda) which seems to be like the cookbook for our present incumbents.

Second it is not dumb. In case you are wondering that the ""intellectual level"" of the media has dropped, it is talking to the masses who are not ""intellectual"". It is by design that the content has been ""dumbed down""

> To whom should  propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or to the less educated masses? 

> It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses. 

> What the intelligentsia â or those who today unfortunately 
often go by that name â what they need is not propaganda but scientific instruction. The content of propaganda is not science  any more than the object represented in a poster is art.

> All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. 

> It is not the purpose of propaganda to provide a series of thrills with a view to pleasing these blase gentry. Its chief function is to convince the masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be given time in order that they may absorb information; and only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd. 


About the persistence of the themes, the Hindu-Muslim divide, the ""other"",

> Any variation must not alter the main theme of the propaganda, but must always emphasize the same point. The slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end the stress must always be laid on the slogan itself. In this way alone can propaganda be consistent and dynamic in its effects. 

> Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly, with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then we shall be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results that such a persistent policy secures. The success of any advertisement, whether of a business or a political nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance with which it is employed.

Some people hsd closed a bunch of colony entrance roads with bamboo barricades with help from a friend of mine who runs a decoration business. This happened 2 days ago, without any permission from police, and now if anyone needed to go out to buy essentials, they would be forced to use a gulli (small road) just beside the barricade. 

Note: One of those people had stated two weeks ago on the colony WhatsApp group that he had seen a vegetable vendor licking the vegetables, and when he screamed and tried to catch him, he ran away. (I and many of my friends don't believe him, as he is a far right wnger who wants the complete destruction of muslims, judging from some of his past WhatsApp forwards. Also, there's no way a vendor with a heavy vegetable carrying thela can outrun the man who ""saw him licking"")

The problem with the barricades? The people living around that gully road began having problems with everyone going from that side. Infuriated, they put up a barricade as well. 

One of my friends who lives just beside the barricades, just called me and told that a couple of police vehicles arrived and those people were called. They were scolded heavily and were warned to not do anything like this again. The barricades were then removed.

The case for Covid-19 cases in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2ygx8/the_case_for_covid19_cases_in_india/,0.0,Coronavirus,14.0,g2ygx8,Vishuliaris,"Alright, since thereâs a lot going on, letâs start with the basics:
A Quick recall:Â A new virus strain emerges out of the Wuhan Province of China last December, China declares it on Jan 1, then WHO declares it a âPublic health Emergencyâ on 30th January, then a pandemic on 11th March (A Pandemic is rapid spread of a disease amidst a large populace, within a short interval of time, spanning multiple continents).
Mass hysteria follows, as it usually does these days. Experts suggest social distancing as the best way to ensure lower spread of disease, forcing the government to finally act and ensure shutdown measures, so that our especially overwhelmed healthcare system doesnât get even more so.
The name of this Novel (new) Coronavirus is now SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) since it being a cousin(not sibling, for thatâs reserved for its mutations) of the SARS Coronavirus, a virus responsible for the 2003 SARS pandemic which spread primarily in the South Eastern Countries, and caused 770 deaths and 8000 infected people worldwide;

Hereâs the case, since this is a new virus in town, we cannot possibly diagnose an infected person without testing him/her, this is NOT a seasonal fever/flu virus, this is 10 times deadlier, and has an incubation period (time it can stay alive inside human body) of 14 days, unlike the 3 days of seasonal flu.
Also, a person who is a carrier(who has the virus inside, but doesnât fall sick) will be better able to spread the virus, compared to a sick person who gets noticed and screened out!
Best example of this being the 19 year old (way out of high-risk age groups of 60 years & above) Pizza Delivery guy, with no foreign travel history, in Delhi who tested positive, resulting in 70 families being quarantined.
Point I am trying to make here is that, that you canât confirm Covid-19 cases, until you have enough Covid-19 tests done.
Indiaâs share of Covid-19 tests is 0.2 for every 1000 people!
The Math: Total population of our country being 1,350,689,521, divided by 2,86,714 number of tests (according to last nightâs data) would be 4710.92, which per thousand, is 0.21.
Meaning India has only conducted 0.2 tests per 1000 people, one of the lowest in the world, and the lowest in per capita.
Concurrently, the places with highest number of cases also are the ones who conducted the most number of tests, which isnât mere coincidence.
The Propaganda: As of writing this, India has 13,425 positive cases with 446 deaths, and 1756 recovered, which is being hailed as monumental achievement, compared to other developed countries who have much more sophisticated healthcare systems than we can even imagine. This narrative being pushed by the Authorities is even bigger reason to worry than the pandemic since it is based on either them duping themselves, or the people, either way, we all lose.

The dunning Kruger: Dr RR Gangakhedkar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said in a statement that, India is conducting 24 test for every one positive case diagnosed, which is much higher than Japanâs 11.7, Italyâs 6.7, & USâ 5.3. Quite frankly this metric escapes my understanding, because:

If we can conduct tests for 24 individuals for every single positive case, and if the growth trends in the cases follow, then weâll be able to test each and every one of 1.3 billion citizens in a couple of weeks. Not sure there are currently enough test kits in the world, let alone in India, for pulling off such a feat.

Say out of a sample of 500 of such 24 individualsâ tests, we get one positive case(optimistically speaking), then currently we have 1,12,557 infected people who havenât been diagnosed yet, a number which will significantly spike, by the time they are identified, let alone tested.",2020-04-17 22:40:03
COVID-19: Sree Chitraâs new test kit set to bring sample-to-result time below two hours!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2y0uu/covid19_sree_chitras_new_test_kit_set_to_bring/,8.0,Coronavirus,43.0,g2y0uu,Xenomorph007,"*Thiruvananthapuram:*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

Untill he chooses a profession for himself, why not show him what careers and this world is like  in some kind of Vanity van or exploring bus?

Parental Supervision - Once the kid returns back to home from the school he faces his parents. A lot of parents are not trained to deal with kids. Still these parents advice them, scold, influence and in worst cases, abuse and beat the children. What is the need for a parental supervision after a minimum age like 10?

Colleges - A college for medical science or civil/ mechanical engineering might be necessary. But for computer engineering, what's the need for making a person attend lectures on topic he has already learnt well from Udemy and make him waste 3 years for a course in college that he can cover in just 1.5 years by himself?

Jobs - I have felt a lot of people are frustrated with their jobs. The frustrations can be can be reduced if we give them atleast a 10 day vacation to a peaceful place after every 90 days. Makes it 40 days in a year. Government Jobs have 30. Private jobs give lesser than that. In India, this is even more important as traffic and noise is too much in the cities and people crave for a heaven escape after every few weeks or months. 

Arranged Marriage - Its often difficult for those in a love marriage to keep the love intact for upto 50 years. Imagine how scary it would be for those in an arranged marriage to live together for even 10 years.

Stigma against Hookup Culture - Nations like India are famous for tinder bios like ""Not here for hookups"". Even a lot of parents of girls are against sex before marriage, compelling these girls to meet their boyfriends in secrecy. I don't know why parents do this but I have heard it is done to increase the value and sanctity of their daughter for the groom who comes as the highest bidder with the highest paying job.

Following is the text of the tweet, verbatim:

""A Jamati died of Corona when police and doctors went to check their families they were attacked and killed, make these mullas + secular media stand in a line and shoot them dead... F**k history. They may call us Nazis who cares, life is more important than fake image."" [1]

Rangoli Chandel was followed on Twitter by over 100 thousand people. The tweet remained for everyone to see for almost a whole day. It was retweeted 1497 times and liked by over 5600 people.

Last year, in the wake of the Pulwama attack, Kangana Ranaut had said this of Shabana Azmi and Pakistan:

""The film industry is full of such anti-nationals who boost enemies' morals in many ways, but right now is the time to focus on decisive actions. Pakistan's ban is not the focus, Pakistan's destruction is."" [2]

Earlier this year, the Indian government awarded Kangana Padma Shri, the country's 4th highest civilian honor.

Yeah Yeah i know its bad form to downplay corona virus right now.

But if the mortality rate is **0.2%** in **10 - 39** range and **0.4%** in **39-40** range then the overall mortality rate would be about **0.32 - 0.35% in under 50 range.**

Why not let people under 50 to go back to work with the obvious restrictions ....compulsory face mask and gloves ....some social distancing ....safeguards like temperature check ...companies that allow only under 50 years aged employees to work and also implement basic safeguards to be allowed to function after getting permission from authorities etc ...

I mean according to \[govt of india figures\]( [http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes\_of\_death\_2001-03.pdf](http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes_of_death_2001-03.pdf)/ )

In the age group 25-69, the leading causes of death in this age group are:

Cardiovascular diseases (25%), Â¾

COPD, asthma, other respiratory (10.2%),

Tuberculosis (10.1%),

Malignant and other neoplasms (9%),

Symptoms signs and ill-defined conditions (5.3%),

Digestive diseases (5.1%),

Diarrhoeal diseases (5%)

Unintentional injuries: Other (4.6%),

Intentional self-harm or suicide (3%),

and Malaria (2.8%).

**India** \- **Adult mortality rate** between age 15 and 60

In 2015, **adult mortality rate** for **India** was 31.43 deaths per 100 population.

so even if we end up with 25% of the allowed adult population (0-49 years) infected with corona virus over the next 6 months ....the mortality rate is only 0.35% - which means death toll of 95,000 or 0.007% of population

Keep in mind 90% of corona virus infections are asymptomatic - so only 4-5% of the infected actually end up needing hospitalization.

Ok ....you can shoot me down now and say i am missing the point and have got it all wrong.

There are 2 one rupee coins in circulation, the older one rupee coin is almost the same size as the newer 2 rupee coin. It is necessary to read the amount on the coin before paying.
If we make coins with different shapes or with different number of holes according to the denomination would be easier to figure out the value without reading. Remember the old 2 rupee coin used to be some polygon instead of a circle and the 5, 10 ,20 paise used to be different shapes. If the coins have different shapes, the shapes can be maintained even with the coins are being resized to ease perceiving the value.",2020-04-21 18:34:14

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 
  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 
2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 
3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   
  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   
  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes. If it wasn't so time sensative, I could wait, but we are out of time for me to be super super patient.",2020-04-21 18:30:23

After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 
China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byjuâs, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 
After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 
Key question to ask are:
1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 
2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 
3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?
Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the ""ban button"" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi's favourite, for all situations.",2020-04-21 2:18:54

The  Prime Minister's post came on a day when a police case was filed  against a hospital in Uttar Pradesh after it placed an ad in local  papers that it would admit Muslim patients only after COVID-19  screening.
Earlier this month, the Indian government had said that [certain communities and neighbourhoods are being vilified](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-covid-19-do-not-target-any-community-area-for-spread-of-coronavirus-says-centre-2208542)  based on false reports floating on social media and elsewhere, issuing  an advisory to address the social stigma and discrimination surrounding  the COVID-19 pandemic.
The advisory asked people not to spread on  social media the names, identity or the locality of those affected by  the virus or under quarantine. It also urged people to avoid spreading  fear and panic.

Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 
With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.
I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.
Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 
After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.
Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.
After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.
TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.
Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad's healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.",2020-04-20 19:06:40

why are so many indians and sri lankans so arrogant?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4i22d/why_are_so_many_indians_and_sri_lankans_so/,7.0,AskIndia,7.0,g4i22d,Rimbaud33,"I know they're not the same but i will just say india instead of saying ""India and sri lanka"" every single time because india is more relevant to my subjective experience and because of simplicity, so im not meaning to offend anybody but i've met people from both bakcgrounds and i like and respect their culture but i've noticed something that i usually ignore unitl it's just too annoying
&#x200B;
So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).
Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.
&#x200B;
Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.
&#x200B;
I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?
&#x200B;
Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.
&#x200B;
Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.
&#x200B;
I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online
&#x200B;
it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?
&#x200B;
I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?
&#x200B;
Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?
&#x200B;
do indian people live in denial?
&#x200B;
or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?
&#x200B;
the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay
&#x200B;
I just don't get it
&#x200B;
what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?
I'd like to know what you guys think :)
&#x200B;
edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong. 
Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics, not always, of course, i'm not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality, but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience.
I hope i didn't offend anyone because i am genuinely interested in this, i like indian food, folklore, art and philosophy i am personally inclined to buddhism :) ",2020-04-20 13:13:31

The government didn't take any measure to implement widespread testing, hence we really don't have enough data to identify the clusters or hotspots.  It's like a ticking time bomb; once the lockdown is over, in a matter of weeks we could expect the infection cases to climb up again exponentially. 
Not to mention, they just left the poorest of the poor to die helplessly on the roads. Are we just going to ignore the piles of bodies?

HCQ to be tested on thousands in Mumbaiâs Dharavi and Worli to prevent Covid-19 spread,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4dtqh/hcq_to_be_tested_on_thousands_in_mumbais_dharavi/,7.0,Science/Technology,14.0,g4dtqh,whine_glass,"BMC is going to start testing effectiveness of HCQ among residents of Worli and Dharavi ([Article](https://theprint.in/health/hcq-to-be-tested-on-thousands-in-mumbais-dharavi-and-worli-to-prevent-covid-19-spread/404133/)). From what I know, the drug has side-effects and it's efficacy has been contested in several clinical trials. The article mentions that the initial plan of testing 50,000 people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study.
As a layman, I had the following questions:
- What are the possible side-effects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions?
- Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions (quality of water, sanitation etc.), is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely? What implications does it have for the results of the experiment, even if it's carried out as planned? (Link to study for this claim [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141369/))
- Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past? From what I know, such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale.
- Thoughts about notion of informed consent for this study under these conditions?

> 
> During January 26âFebruary 10, 2020, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters. The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation.

r/COVID19 post: https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g3sgcf/covid19_outbreak_associated_with_air_conditioning/
Personally I think we need to give importance to the fact that there are summer viruses and winter viruses and they need different combinations of temperature+humidity.
Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/transmission/
> Humidity (best if between 50% and 80%)
> 
> ""It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane"" [source] Relative humidity (RH, or Saturation Ratio: the state of vapor equilibrium in room air) affects all infectious droplets with respiratory viruses, independent of their source (respiratory tract or aerosolized from any fluid) and location (in air or settled on surfaces). Relative humidity therefore affects all transmission ways but has the most pronounced effect on airborne transmission. [source]
> 
> ""Measurements of indoor humidities in 40 residential apartments in New York (19) and in 6 high-quality commercial buildings in the Midwest (20) showed indoor vapor pressure of below 10 mb or indoor RH of below 24% in the winter"" [source]
> 
> Experiments conducted in a study indicated ""a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH (20â50%), while the stability of summer or all-year viruses enhanced at higher RH (80%)"" [source]
Therefore, while our population size, education/awareness and density are strong disadvantages to us, **maybe** there is some advantage to be had if we **stop using air-conditioning entirely for the duration of the pandemic wherever possible**. 
This is speculation, but I believe **it merits proper investigation**.

What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g43omc/what_ht_wouldnt_publish_the_folly_and_vanity_of/,3.0,Policy/Economy,16.0,g43omc,bob_semple_,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)
Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  
*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 
In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhiâs Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: âWhy is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capitalâs catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?â
In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores âon a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhiâs pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the peopleâs good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.â
The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishoreâs article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firmâs previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their executionÂ  âupon the removal of  âobstaclesâ like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practicesâ. The firmâs past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting âan innate disrespect for the  citizenâ.
In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:
âThe biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs ElysÃ©es? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: âIt brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayerâs expense.â
Kishoreâs essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.
In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.
Also read: [In Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Central Vista Project Should Be Reviewed](https://thewire.in/urban/covid-19-central-vista-project-new-delhi)
The prime ministerâs own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone â the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldnât quite do  for Narendra Modi.
To my mind, the Modi governmentâs redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  rulerâs immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean BÃ©del-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaulâs essay â[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)â).
Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  
As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why canât the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme â estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting â be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?
Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money â not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year â probably longer â before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.
In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice â sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.
*Postscript: While spiking this particular article, the* Hindustan Times  *left open the possibility of my continuing to write on other (and  presumably from the paperâs point of view safer) subjects. I have  however chosen to discontinue my column in the newspaper.*",2020-04-19 21:07:38

So my father has an essential store and he gets this message on whatsapp saying that govt has launched a website to register your company as Suraksha Store so that they can get govt benefits.
Website: [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (very believable domain for the average non tech guy)
Here is what made me suspicious:
1. The website didn't open for me as I had high-security settings for chrome (ERR: Too many redirects)
2. No mention of website in any news
3. Powered by SafeJob at the end which is a private company
4. Copyright to suraksha circle (i.e. the circle that GOI has asked us to make where people will stand)
5. After filling the form, it asked us to get a certificate so that we can get approved faster and that certification needs us to login to their website [safejob.in](https://safejob.in) where we need to create account and do a suraksha certificate course
6. The course is a video where they explain how to make your store a suraksha store and then asks a basic quiz (which is a good deed they're doing acc. to me)
Here are my findings:
1. Terminal command I used:-  whois  [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (Only for tech guys)
2. The domain is being bought by Vineet Tiwari of Safeducate
3. There was no information that I could find linked to GOI
4. I checked socials of both safejob and safeducate (none of them have posted about it)
5. On website of safeducate, it says Ministry of rural development  but on surakshastore, it's ministry of home affairs (This might be against my hypothesis)
Link of whois result: [https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com](https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com&recaptchaResponse=03AHaCkAYKFQoubZUr1si98nAJnDn0VM5x5Z43VMMjUoyLO1OfY6lZsxqf1KTMRFuBsIi-l1TfdDBlHZ8lnGsQITNwXSt0vzgA9qzvXb0vT-855S7tRKA89dveP9obUN1_-4h7_BMwDaHKbO10AhbG4UDY6cgIKuESpGtZuoB0ButrjvBGiUqvDeaZ0rheIJiXAfst1Ur0jfVO2kLAyWXtK06gIqJ91T5GNjTbLLFxLxiJDlMY_Xw_Z13ms4xI2exVKuKWLsEF6CxdGASDWCqJFs6ZRmhX3i32QIYVxC0Q5n-p1qHW8r1-Q0KfTP3SML-_LYUisjC8ov5kzPWswqFk2fP3l_p5gNwCPxZ57_NWY6SPL4NO1zck4RvLec_PsHxBc3siRu0R1RArgdRwKA3YzlcyD_kvPxKpcQ)

Although I highly think this is a scam, I would want to ask you guys if you think otherwise and if you also find that this website is a scam, please notify your Whatsapp groups. (Lies circulate through WhatsApp, so let the truth tackle it there itself)
I'm open to any sources that prove that this is not a scam. If it is a scam, then you have to be the lowest of scums to make profit in these times scamming people.

Vodafone India TERRIBLE SERVICE,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g42eq3/vodafone_india_terrible_service/,53.0,Non-Political,67.0,g42eq3,praharshnbhatt,"I'm a Redx customer (Rs 999/mo), and Vodafone promises ""Unlimited internet"", with ""No max limit"" for this plan. I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.
I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.
Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!
I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!
I also tried and opened a case with resolver, wrote to their social media channels including Twitter, nowhere could I get any help.

India is a stark contrast compared the USA from what I've seen, but that has only made me want to travel there even more. I had some burning questions I would love some answers to. Besides some YouTubers and books, it can be hard to get some valuable information about traveling to India, as most Americans are baffled at the thought of me VOLUNTARILY wanting to go to India, and only think of it as a dirty and extremely poor 3rd world country without even researching the country.
1. Would you recommend doing a guided tour (even though they can be cheesy and touristic at times) for my first time in India or would it be doable to solo travel or travel with a few friends? I've heard India can be very overwhelming for foreigners at first, but I wanted to know your thoughts.
2. What are some safety tips that are actually TRUE and not stereotypical. I've heard about the poor water quality, Delhi belly (caution against street food), beggars, so HOT, not to walk outside at night, scammers on the street, dirty, filled with pollution, etc. but I want to know if there is any truth to any of this and what I can do to have a great experience.
3. What cities (and sights) would you most recommend for a first-timer in India if I were to travel there for 7-10 days? Where can I find the busiest and most chaotic streets in India (as this fascinates me, as in the USA the roads are very organized). What kind of budget would I need for 7-10 days?
4. Also just out of curiosity, what stereotypes of India or Indian people would you wish to disappear as they are not true?
5. What else can I do to best prepare for a trip to India?

"TIL that in UP and Bihar, almost six out of ten deaths were not registered in the death statistics (based on the latest available CRS data from 2017)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3n6wq/til_that_in_up_and_bihar_almost_six_out_of_ten/,0.0,Coronavirus,13.0,g3n6wq,jai_ho_kick,"  
TL;DR, India lacks systematic registration of deaths even in the absence of the current pandemic. It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.
  
There have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India's success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.
Today, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).
I was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):
1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).
2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.
Moreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The ""cause of death"" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))
Given these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. 
These are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths.",2020-04-19 2:34:45

India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/,123.0,Non-Political,224.0,g3mehq,kullky_2020,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.
You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?
I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.
What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?
Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",2020-04-19 1:30:47

* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.

There was an offer by a bank in which I have an account so she requested me to get the offer from my card and I hesitatingly accepted it. 
First 4 months she paid back the EMI amount that got debited from my account on time. 
But now she wonât accept my calls and WhatsApp is also one tick so she may have blocked me. She hasnât paid back two EMI debits and my bank balance has gone in negative. I have to do my shopping on my credit card now. 
I went online on netbanking but I couldnât find any option for ongoing EMIs. 
Total amount of the laptop was around 1,40,000 and she paid me back around 28,000 and now she owes me around 14,000.

Sino-Indian Relationship post COVID-19 (DISCUSSION).,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3kqnp/sinoindian_relationship_post_covid19_discussion/,4.0,Policy/Economy,12.0,g3kqnp,AdmiralSP,"Note: This it a self post and NOT VERIFIED NEWS.
I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.
Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.
China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*",2020-04-18 21:17:29

I recently had an argument with my Mom, about the role of muslims in the recent covid 19 spread in India. I said I'm not disagreeing that certain groups of the muslim community are solely responsible for a massive spike in infections, but the tone that you are implying means that you had a problem with muslims long before this covid infection started.

Upon hearing this, she went full defensive mode, saying muslims are responsible for all the wars with India and they are responsible for every atrocity in India. I asked how many muslims have you spoken to in your life ?  She said she knows about Pakistan and the wars and that is enough. She said they are ""abishwas jati""

Our argument heated up and now I'm here asking what do I do to change her opinion that all muslims aren't ""Pakistani"" and aren't out to destroy the world. Media doesn't portray muslim in good light and it has led to years of indoctrination with older people who have no other contact other than media. But I am not saying I am apologising for muslims. I am an atheist and consider all religions to be irrelevant, islam to be the most if I had to draw a priority chart.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  One more point, To make matters worse, when Italy was #1 in covid infections, I found she was googling, ""how many muslims are there in Italy"". It was both hilarious and sad that she drew causality vs correlation, though that argument would have failed as well as Italy is not a muslim majority country.",2020-04-18 15:45:50

IFFâs Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paperâs analysis of the partnership through the lens of whatâs good, possible risks and the projectâs relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.


Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the worldâs two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.


Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.


To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required. Â Similar to Singaporeâs *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFFâs Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every userâs device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance peopleâs privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu appâs own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their âclose proximityâ interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individualâs phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other personâs phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.


One of the large outcomes of the coronavirusâ impact in relation to peopleâs increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on peopleâs movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect peopleâs fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to peopleâs personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations. Â Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the projectâs first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions. Â Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.


It is important to highlight that Indiaâs Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFFâs submission will address the whitepaper/consultationâs interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

I came to this city on 16th march in a private vehicle, not with public transport.I m staying at my aunt's house since then.  But due to lockdown, the admission (NEET PG) got postponed. But they have resumed it through online method.  

Now here's the problem. This place has a hell lot of mosquitoes. Tonight i had high grade fever with chills and rigor. No coughing, sneezing or breathing issues of any kind.I m highly suspicious that it is malaria. If i tell my aunt, she will panic, and will ask me to leave. If i stay here, I won't be cured, bz, no matter what i try, I can't get rid of mosquitoes (this house doesn't has a mosquito net). And if i go to a hospital and get admitted, my aunt won't accept me back once i m discharged. I don't know what to do.
Although i can get myself tested for malaria and start the treatment, if it's positive, on my own, hiding the fact from my aunt's family and hoping for recovery in this mosquito infested locality. 
For the record, I don't go out of the house, have been practicing social distancing, and as of today this city has zero COVID19 patients. Please suggest something.",2020-04-18 13:18:01

Need help regarding my career. Specifically MBA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g35581/need_help_regarding_my_career_specifically_mba/,22.0,AskIndia,9.0,g35581,para97k,"Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",2020-04-18 5:49:56

How much testing is enough testing ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g33qna/how_much_testing_is_enough_testing/,3.0,Coronavirus,11.0,g33qna,Deepfriedpakoda,"  
Every time someone mentions that the number of Covid cases are low in India, you are likely to meet the ""We aren't doing enough testing"" quote.   
When you consider the data point of ""tests per million"", you will see India faring quite bad but again most of the other countries aren't dealing with a huge population crisis or even the vastness of a country like ours.   
So don't you think no matter how many tests we conduct we are anyways going to fare lowly in that metric point ? So my question is why are we complaining about the low number of tests per million and is it actually a valid data point for us to ponder over ?   
Data Source : [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries)   
If you notice China which is our closest in terms of population has played with their numbers to an extent where no one knows whats real or whats not. So what metric can I look at and say ""Hey the govt is not doing that bad a job"" or ""Hey, it's a shit show out there""!

Is it a hogwash by Sanghi media to project Yogi as an alternative to Modi or the PR is because of the TRP and clickbaits  which yogi Adityanath gives to news channels and online portals.

Some colony folks had put up barricades blocking locality entrances without any permission from the police or any other authority.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2x8rp/some_colony_folks_had_put_up_barricades_blocking/,7.0,Coronavirus,55.0,g2x8rp,abhilash1991,"Another incident from my locality, after the last two that I had posted earlier. Some people hsd closed a bunch of colony entrance roads with bamboo barricades with help from a friend of mine who runs a decoration business. This happened 2 days ago, without any permission from police, and now if anyone needed to go out to buy essentials, they would be forced to use a gulli (small road) just beside the barricade. 

Note: One of those people had stated two weeks ago on the colony WhatsApp group that he had seen a vegetable vendor licking the vegetables, and when he screamed and tried to catch him, he ran away. (I and many of my friends don't believe him, as he is a far right wnger who wants the complete destruction of muslims, judging from some of his past WhatsApp forwards.

The problem with the barricades? The people living around that gully road began having problems with everyone going from that side. Infuriated, they put up a barricade as well. 

One of my friends who lives just beside the barricades, just called me and told that a couple of police vehicles arrived and those people were called. They were scolded heavily and were warned to not do anything like this again. The barricades were then removed. 

I was extremely angry at the fact that they didn't even think of other people who live there, while putting up barricades without permission. It was an unnecessary move that didn't serve any purpose.

The case for Covid-19 cases in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2ygx8/the_case_for_covid19_cases_in_india/,0.0,Coronavirus,11.0,g2ygx8,Vishuliaris,"Alright, since thereâs a lot going on, letâs start with the basics:
A Quick recall:Â A new virus strain emerges out of the Wuhan Province of China last December, China declares it on Jan 1, then WHO declares it a âPublic health Emergencyâ on 30th January, then a pandemic on 11th March (A Pandemic is rapid spread of a disease amidst a large populace, within a short interval of time, spanning multiple continents).
Mass hysteria follows, as it usually does these days. Experts suggest social distancing as the best way to ensure lower spread of disease, forcing the government to finally act and ensure shutdown measures, so that our especially overwhelmed healthcare system doesnât get even more so.
The name of this Novel (new) Coronavirus is now SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) since it being a cousin(not sibling, for thatâs reserved for its mutations) of the SARS Coronavirus, a virus responsible for the 2003 SARS pandemic which spread primarily in the South Eastern Countries, and caused 770 deaths and 8000 infected people worldwide;

Hereâs the case, since this is a new virus in town, we cannot possibly diagnose an infected person without testing him/her, this is NOT a seasonal fever/flu virus, this is 10 times deadlier, and has an incubation period (time it can stay alive inside human body) of 14 days, unlike the 3 days of seasonal flu.
Also, a person who is a carrier(who has the virus inside, but doesnât fall sick) will be better able to spread the virus, compared to a sick person who gets noticed and screened out!
Best example of this being the 19 year old (way out of high-risk age groups of 60 years & above) Pizza Delivery guy, with no foreign travel history, in Delhi who tested positive, resulting in 70 families being quarantined.
Point I am trying to make here is that, that you canât confirm Covid-19 cases, until you have enough Covid-19 tests done.
Indiaâs share of Covid-19 tests is 0.2 for every 1000 people!
The Math: Total population of our country being 1,350,689,521, divided by 2,86,714 number of tests (according to last nightâs data) would be 4710.92, which per thousand, is 0.21.
Meaning India has only conducted 0.2 tests per 1000 people, one of the lowest in the world, and the lowest in per capita.
Concurrently, the places with highest number of cases also are the ones who conducted the most number of tests, which isnât mere coincidence.
The Propaganda: As of writing this, India has 13,425 positive cases with 446 deaths, and 1756 recovered, which is being hailed as monumental achievement, compared to other developed countries who have much more sophisticated healthcare systems than we can even imagine. This narrative being pushed by the Authorities is even bigger reason to worry than the pandemic since it is based on either them duping themselves, or the people, either way, we all lose.

The dunning Kruger: Dr RR Gangakhedkar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said in a statement that, India is conducting 24 test for every one positive case diagnosed, which is much higher than Japanâs 11.7, Italyâs 6.7, & USâ 5.3. Quite frankly this metric escapes my understanding, because:

If we can conduct tests for 24 individuals for every single positive case, and if the growth trends in the cases follow, then weâll be able to test each and every one of 1.3 billion citizens in a couple of weeks. Not sure there are currently enough test kits in the world, let alone in India, for pulling off such a feat.

Say out of a sample of 500 of such 24 individualsâ tests, we get one positive case(optimistically speaking), then currently we have 1,12,557 infected people who havenât been diagnosed yet, a number which will significantly spike, by the time they are identified, let alone tested.",2020-04-17 22:40:03

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

Hey Everyone,
I am bored out of my mind. Since I have experience in the Personal Care Appliance industry, so thought of creating this post to help the first time trimmer buyers in Quarrantine. I have tested all of these products at one time or the other. This seems like a need for many of the people in the male demographic
Note : Only the products which are deliverable will be featured. Currently only Flipkart is delivering so I am only featuring Flipkart Products. Will edit this post later to include
**TLDR**

3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home
[Nova Hair Clipper](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) Price Rs 1295
**Detailed Analysis**
**Beard Trimmer**
**Economy Segment**
[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349
Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings
Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched
Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi
**Premium Segment**
[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.
Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition
**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**
Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits
**Economy Segment**
[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299
Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings
5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb
No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great
**Premium Segment**
[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599
Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones
My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052
**Hair Clippers**
Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now
[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

Unpopular opinion - lockdown extension was uncalled for,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g5djsa/unpopular_opinion_lockdown_extension_was_uncalled/,23.0,Policy/Economy,0.0,g5djsa,Sefffaroque,"Unpopular opinion, I think this extreme lockdown extension  was uncalled for, ppl who support this extension are like âoh no 20 k ppl infected, 200 ppl have died, if we donât stop this now by extending this lockdown, lacs of ppl will die!!, so stop cribbing and do your bit! â 
For comparison in India, 50 lac ppl / children die every year to totally avoidable / curable maladies like typhoid, polio, child malnutrition etc etc 
Destroying an entire countries economy and causing the loss of livelihoods and inadvertently lives coz a few hundred / thousand  ppl who have some serious underlying conditions are gonna die  is not the smartest thing to do ( also over 90% are asymptotmatic as has been proved by Iceland which has conducted tests for like 20% of its population ; asymptotic meaning they donât show any symptoms and go back to normal without even realizing) 
So again is this extreme step that has totally handicapped our country from ground up even worth it?? 
I mean I am sure soo many ppl would have died as a result of this lockdown itself, ppl who needed medical attention for some other ailment, ppl who couldnât get their fix ( alcohol etch) ppl who lost their jobs their families and their minds (migrant workers getting screwed over anyone) 
I am not even including the multifold increase of ppl/ children  dying of the aforementioned maladies ( typhoid, polio, child malnutritionetc) that will surely increase by several multiples this year due to the lockdown itself. 
I think the entire thing is a fools errand and with every extension the returns are diminishing . 
As the reality is we might need to extend this lockdown till we get a vaccine in a country like India, as the lockdown by itself canât curb this menace, and a vaccine might take two years at-least by the looks of it. 
So can we afford to go into an extended lockdown till then? I hope we donât do that.",2020-04-22 1:01:28

A popular Ambedkarite journalist has said in a long post that the reason most of the freedom fighters were from upper caste because they were scared that British administration might break their status quo .,their ancestors never rebelled against Mughal or delhi sultanate.
In the entire Mughal history, most of upper caste had  tremendous respect and had acquired good positions in Mughal administration . Rajputs who are now flaunting swords must remember that they not only surrender their swords ,but also gave their daughters in Mughal harem in exchange of keeping their zamindari intact.
The Flag bearer against Mughal shahi were Marathas who were a farmer caste in Maharashtra and definitely they were not Kshatriyas.",2020-04-22 0:16:29
[Help] Potential SIM swapping/hacking,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g5cv1j/help_potential_sim_swappinghacking/,3.0,AskIndia,16.0,g5cv1j,cvrjk,"Hi /r/india,
I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 
Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.
Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.
But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.
Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?
Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!
P.S: I checked my own Aadhar card's authentication history anyway, just to confirm, and there are no records for any recent access.",2020-04-22 0:05:55

The numbers dont seem to be decreasing. Nor they are increasing dramatically.   
Both facts somewhat concern me, they should be decreasing right? we enforced lockdown to decrease spread. And we are planning on opening lockdowns when the numbers have not even started their downward trend!   
Also why the numbers are not increasing!? Is it because we are doing really less testing and the numbers that should be caught are not being caught. If we have the capacity to do more testing we would end up catching more people with the virus?  
Given our lockdown is not the most strictly enforced lockdown, the spread will keep happening. Argh, sometimes the situation seems quite hopeless! :/

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 
  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 
2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 
3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   
  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   
  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk?

"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4s5yd/indian_govt_banning_investment_from_china_is_yet/,12.0,Policy/Economy,0.0,g4s5yd,ShortTesla_Rekt5,"Modi is on a killing spree. After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 
China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byjuâs, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 
After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 
Key question to ask are:
1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 
2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 
3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?
Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the ""ban button"" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi's favourite, for all situations.",2020-04-21 2:18:54

India and UAE share the values  of non-discrimination on any grounds, the Indian ambassador to the  country tweeted on Monday amid growing resentment in the Arab world over  reports of Muslims being targeted in India over the coronavirus  pandemic.
""**India and UAE share the value of non-discrimination on  any grounds. Discrimination is against our moral fabric and the Rule of  law. Indian nationals in the UAE should always remember this**,""  Ambassador Pavan Kapoor.

The advisory asked people not to spread on  social media the names, identity or the locality of those affected by  the virus or under quarantine. It also urged people to avoid spreading  fear and panic.
The advisory came after a spurt in coronavirus  cases following a religious congregation organised by the Tablighi  Jamaat at its Markaz or headquarters in Delhi's Nizamuddin area, and  instances of people blaming the Muslim community for the spread of the  disease.",2020-04-21 6:20:38

India has a large population, a low wage rate, and a political ideology more aligned with the rest of the world. India's people are also young,  tech savvy, and have better English skills than the Chinese.

He was extremely vocal against illegal river sand mining.
Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 
With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.
I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.

So remaining those who have become teacher are not by choice they are just going there for few hours to earn money and not putting real effort. 
Because of not enough competition in this sector we are not able to generate best teaching potential from ourselves. It's effect would be seen in the long term.
 When we see in the elementary education we don't have good teachers with liberal views and professional ethics. What students will see they learn and grow with similar stereotypes.

Alternative credit score & Automating the Entire process to reduce the Turn around time of loans into seconds
I want to solve this problems 
- In India, Just 35 millions pay Income tax out of 130 millions. Here credit underwriting model uses credit bureau data, Bank statements, Income tax returns.  So, 97% people are not accessed to formal credit. Still they borrow from the loan mafia & they charge exorbitant interest rates. There is need for alternative credit assessment, by using smartphone data & using social security numbers. 
- The Turn around time for the loans is 7 days to 3 Months. While the world battles issues centering around data privacy and consent, the Account Aggregator & Indian stack will allow both individuals and businesses to share their financial data in digital form with third parties in a safe manner. 
- Credit Risk - Risky Business 
 
Predicting the risk of customer credit default. How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. 
Unlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer. By applying advances in machine learning we can able to radically outperform traditional scorecards in both consumer and small business lending. 
By building models on more than simple default, and focusing on such outcomes as profitability and customer lifetime value, we allow you to fully leverage artificial intelligence to increase your lending performance. 
- Ample computing power and digital data are the fuel for machine learning, of course. The more data and the more iterations the algorithmic engine goes through, the better its output gets. Data scientists come up with probabilistic prediction models for specific actions, and then the algorithm churns through loads of data to produce better decisions in real time with every iteration. These prediction models become the basis for most business decisions.
- we applied for Account aggregator license from Reserve bank of India, we get all public data like Banking, Mutual funds, insurance etc. we are in the process building the consortium to share non financial data.
- By Automating the entire process &  building the algorithms using supervised learning, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, Experimenting & building software stack. I hope we can solve this problem. 
- current credit bureau has many flaws like their algorithm is  blatantly opaque, they donât use real time data, their business model itself skeptical. 
- So, we want to start a platform which can adds value to the both lenders & borrowers.
- We are looking for AI, ML engineers, data scientists who can build probabilistic models, blockchain enthusiasts,Front end designers for building the application & app.

What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g43omc/what_ht_wouldnt_publish_the_folly_and_vanity_of/,3.0,Policy/Economy,19.0,g43omc,bob_semple_,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)
Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  
*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 
In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhiâs Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: âWhy is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capitalâs catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?â
In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores âon a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhiâs pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the peopleâs good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.â
The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishoreâs article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firmâs previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their executionÂ  âupon the removal of  âobstaclesâ like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practicesâ. The firmâs past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting âan innate disrespect for the  citizenâ.
In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:
âThe biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs ElysÃ©es? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: âIt brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayerâs expense.â
Kishoreâs essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.
In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.

The prime ministerâs own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone â the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldnât quite do  for Narendra Modi.
To my mind, the Modi governmentâs redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  rulerâs immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean BÃ©del-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaulâs essay â[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)â).
Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  
As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why canât the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme â estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting â be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?
Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money â not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year â probably longer â before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.
In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice â sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.
Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.
This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs
This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.
I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.
YOU are in charge of your body.

India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/,121.0,Non-Political,217.0,g3mehq,kullky_2020,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",2020-04-19 1:30:47
Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3lncu/horlics_chocolate_powder_vs_cadbury_cocoa_powder/,23.0,Food,15.0,g3lncu,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

So I heard about Asur from Reddit where op praises the show, so checked IMDb, it had a rating of 8.7 so I decided to give it a shot.
Watched it within 2 days and was completely disappointed .
The show is full of plot holes some of these are,
* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.
*Oxygen chamber having timer instead of an oximeter. Also the clock speed up when hostages are idle but works Normal when they're trying to kill eachother where oxygen consumption is increased.

You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.

The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.

The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

Only thing which is good is the soundtrack.
A complete disappointment.

I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.

Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

Mom being inherently biased against muslims.

I recently had an argument with my Mom, about the role of muslims in the recent covid 19 spread in India. I said I'm not disagreeing that certain groups of the muslim community are solely responsible for a massive spike in infections, but the tone that you are implying means that you had a problem with muslims long before this covid infection started.

Upon hearing this, she went full defensive mode, saying muslims are responsible for all the wars with India and they are responsible for every atrocity in India. I asked how many muslims have you spoken to in your life ?  She said she knows about Pakistan and the wars and that is enough. She said they are ""abishwas jati""

Our argument heated up and now I'm here asking what do I do to change her opinion that all muslims aren't ""Pakistani"" and aren't out to destroy the world. Media doesn't portray muslim in good light and it has led to years of indoctrination with older people who have no other contact other than media. But I am not saying I am apologising for muslims. I am an atheist and consider all religions to be irrelevant, islam to be the most if I had to draw a priority chart.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  One more point, To make matters worse, when Italy was #1 in covid infections, I found she was googling, ""how many muslims are there in Italy"". It was both hilarious and sad that she drew causality vs correlation, though that argument would have failed as well as Italy is not a muslim majority country.",2020-04-18 15:45:50

IFFâs Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paperâs analysis of the partnership through the lens of whatâs good, possible risks and the projectâs relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.


Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the worldâs two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.


Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.


To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required. Â Similar to Singaporeâs *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFFâs Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every userâs device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance peopleâs privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu appâs own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their âclose proximityâ interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individualâs phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other personâs phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.


One of the large outcomes of the coronavirusâ impact in relation to peopleâs increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on peopleâs movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect peopleâs fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to peopleâs personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations. Â Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the projectâs first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions. Â Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.


It is important to highlight that Indiaâs Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFFâs submission will address the whitepaper/consultationâs interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

Need help regarding my career. Specifically MBA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g35581/need_help_regarding_my_career_specifically_mba/,22.0,AskIndia,11.0,g35581,para97k,"Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",2020-04-18 5:49:56

2. On  Flipkart it says Lenovo y530 has an expandable ram up to 16GB whereas  strix g has 32GB expandable. So, ofcourse I want to buy a future proof  laptop and 32GB sounds way better than 16GB not gonna lie but I am not  sure even that much amount of ram will be useful.
3. Asus  rog strix g doesn't come with a camera. I usually don't use camera in  India but I am going to college outside India and I don't want to carry  an extra accessory with the already heavy laptop. So, I need a camera  inbuilt if at all possible. Lastly,
4. The battery, I don't know which has a better battery.
Which laptop would you suggest I should go for? Some input would be appreciated. Thank you!

I have tested all of these products at one time or the other. This seems like a need for many of the people in the male demographic
Note : Only the products which are deliverable will be featured. Currently only Flipkart is delivering so I am only featuring Flipkart Products. Will edit this post later to include

3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home
[Nova Hair Clipper](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) Price Rs 1295
**Detailed Analysis**
**Beard Trimmer**
**Economy Segment**
[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349
Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings
Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched
Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi
**Premium Segment**
[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.
Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition
**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**
Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits
**Economy Segment**
[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299
Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings
5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb
No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great
**Premium Segment**
[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599
Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones
My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052
**Hair Clippers**
Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now
[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

Unpopular opinion - lockdown extension was uncalled for,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g5djsa/unpopular_opinion_lockdown_extension_was_uncalled/,24.0,Policy/Economy,0.0,g5djsa,Sefffaroque,"Unpopular opinion, I think this extreme lockdown extension  was uncalled for, ppl who support this extension are like âoh no 20 k ppl infected, 200 ppl have died, if we donât stop this now by extending this lockdown, lacs of ppl will die!!, so stop cribbing and do your bit! â 
For comparison in India, 50 lac ppl / children die every year to totally avoidable / curable maladies like typhoid, polio, child malnutrition etc etc 
Destroying an entire countries economy and causing the loss of livelihoods and inadvertently lives coz a few hundred / thousand  ppl who have some serious underlying conditions are gonna die  is not the smartest thing to do ( also over 90% are asymptotmatic as has been proved by Iceland which has conducted tests for like 20% of its population ; asymptotic meaning they donât show any symptoms and go back to normal without even realizing) 
So again is this extreme step that has totally handicapped our country from ground up even worth it?? 
I mean I am sure soo many ppl would have died as a result of this lockdown itself, ppl who needed medical attention for some other ailment, ppl who couldnât get their fix ( alcohol etch) ppl who lost their jobs their families and their minds (migrant workers getting screwed over anyone) 
I am not even including the multifold increase of ppl/ children  dying of the aforementioned maladies ( typhoid, polio, child malnutritionetc) that will surely increase by several multiples this year due to the lockdown itself. 
I think the entire thing is a fools errand and with every extension the returns are diminishing . 
As the reality is we might need to extend this lockdown till we get a vaccine in a country like India, as the lockdown by itself canât curb this menace, and a vaccine might take two years at-least by the looks of it. 
So can we afford to go into an extended lockdown till then? I hope we donât do that.",2020-04-22 1:01:28

A popular Ambedkarite journalist has said in a long post that the reason most of the freedom fighters were from upper caste because they were scared that British administration might break their status quo .,their ancestors never rebelled against Mughal or delhi sultanate.
In the entire Mughal history, most of upper caste had  tremendous respect and had acquired good positions in Mughal administration . Rajputs who are now flaunting swords must remember that they not only surrender their swords ,but also gave their daughters in Mughal harem in exchange of keeping their zamindari intact.

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 
Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.
Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.
But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.
Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?
Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!
P.S: I checked my own Aadhar card's authentication history anyway, just to confirm, and there are no records for any recent access.",2020-04-22 0:05:55

The numbers dont seem to be decreasing. Nor they are increasing dramatically.   
Both facts somewhat concern me, they should be decreasing right? we enforced lockdown to decrease spread. And we are planning on opening lockdowns when the numbers have not even started their downward trend!   
Also why the numbers are not increasing!? Is it because we are doing really less testing and the numbers that should be caught are not being caught. If we have the capacity to do more testing we would end up catching more people with the virus?  
Given our lockdown is not the most strictly enforced lockdown, the spread will keep happening. Argh, sometimes the situation seems quite hopeless! :/

"Why aren't there movies made about important African (Habshi) figures in Indian history?

He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.
His narrative is incredible.
This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.
Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?
I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.
Thoughts?
It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 
  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 
2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 
3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   
  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   
  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes. If it wasn't so time sensative, I could wait, but we are out of time for me to be super super patient.",2020-04-21 18:30:23

India and UAE share the values  of non-discrimination on any grounds, the Indian ambassador to the  country tweeted on Monday amid growing resentment in the Arab world over  reports of Muslims being targeted in India over the coronavirus  pandemic.
""**India and UAE share the value of non-discrimination on  any grounds. Discrimination is against our moral fabric and the Rule of  law. Indian nationals in the UAE should always remember this**,""  Ambassador Pavan Kapoor.

As an 80's kid who grew up watching a lot of TV shows, I have a very strong association with TV shows and a point in time and I was wondering if there are others like me. For example, Swat Kats means weekdays, 4 PM. MTV Select is Mon-Thursday 2 PM, Captain Vyom means Sunday 10 AM, The TNT network music jingle means 9 PM and so on and so forth. I was wondering if you all will indulge me and write down the TV show timings that you remember. If you have a specific TV channel or TV events in your head associated with a certain time of the day, that would be awesome too! (For example, AXN means late nights as that was the only time I could watch it without parents noticing, Formula 1 invokes weekend afternoons, Early mornings mean India-Australia test matches, Star TV reminds me of 9-11 PM when my whole family would watch it).

Prof. G. D. Agarwal, alma mater IIT Roorkee UC Berkeley, died from a fast-unto-death to protest against environmentally destructive projects on Ganga and Bhagirathi .

He was extremely vocal against illegal river sand mining.
Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 
With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.
I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.
Why do you think mainstream media wants us to focus on Timur ?

Some use this as a tactic for extorting money from helpless and desperate victims.

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.
Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 
After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.
Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.
After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.
TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.
Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad's healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.",2020-04-20 19:06:40

why are so many indians and sri lankans so arrogant?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4i22d/why_are_so_many_indians_and_sri_lankans_so/,7.0,AskIndia,8.0,g4i22d,Rimbaud33,"I know they're not the same but i will just say india instead of saying ""India and sri lanka"" every single time because india is more relevant to my subjective experience and because of simplicity, so im not meaning to offend anybody but i've met people from both bakcgrounds and i like and respect their culture but i've noticed something that i usually ignore unitl it's just too annoying
&#x200B;
So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).
Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.
&#x200B;
Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.
&#x200B;
I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?
&#x200B;
Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.
&#x200B;
Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.
&#x200B;
I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online
&#x200B;
it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?
&#x200B;
I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?
&#x200B;
Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?
&#x200B;
do indian people live in denial?
&#x200B;
or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?
&#x200B;
the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay
&#x200B;
I just don't get it
&#x200B;
what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?
I'd like to know what you guys think :)
&#x200B;
edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong. 
Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics, not always, of course, i'm not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality, but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience.
I hope i didn't offend anyone because i am genuinely interested in this, i like indian food, folklore, art and philosophy i am personally inclined to buddhism :) ",2020-04-20 13:13:31

> 
> During January 26âFebruary 10, 2020, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters. The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation.

r/COVID19 post: https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g3sgcf/covid19_outbreak_associated_with_air_conditioning/
Personally I think we need to give importance to the fact that there are summer viruses and winter viruses and they need different combinations of temperature+humidity.
Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/transmission/
> Humidity (best if between 50% and 80%)
> 
> ""It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane"" [source] Relative humidity (RH, or Saturation Ratio: the state of vapor equilibrium in room air) affects all infectious droplets with respiratory viruses, independent of their source (respiratory tract or aerosolized from any fluid) and location (in air or settled on surfaces). Relative humidity therefore affects all transmission ways but has the most pronounced effect on airborne transmission. [source]
> 
> ""Measurements of indoor humidities in 40 residential apartments in New York (19) and in 6 high-quality commercial buildings in the Midwest (20) showed indoor vapor pressure of below 10 mb or indoor RH of below 24% in the winter"" [source]
> 
> Experiments conducted in a study indicated ""a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH (20â50%), while the stability of summer or all-year viruses enhanced at higher RH (80%)"" [source]
Therefore, while our population size, education/awareness and density are strong disadvantages to us, **maybe** there is some advantage to be had if we **stop using air-conditioning entirely for the duration of the pandemic wherever possible**. 
This is speculation, but I believe **it merits proper investigation**.

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.
A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 
Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.
>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.
>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).
>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?
>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.
>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!
So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 
Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   
I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing
>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.
She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.
Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 
>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.
>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.
>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.
>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.
â
>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.
>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.
â
>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.
>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!
NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)
I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.
Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.
As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 
Its called Syndicate.
In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.
After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.
Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]
Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.
Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",2020-04-19 22:52:34

It's outrageous to ask for help this often but we are hopeless in this situation as I lost my job and there's no income source left. We are trying to sell our land so that the money will be helpful to us but due to the lockdown which is almost like the second demonatization the economy is down. 
I again request you all to consider sharing the fundraiser forward and donating whatever amount you are comfortable with. Again thank you so much for all the support you have given our family. Thanks very much.

Scamming people to sign up to their platform using the name of SURAKSHA STORE ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3z60v/scamming_people_to_sign_up_to_their_platform/,1.0,Coronavirus,11.0,g3z60v,regover,"Hi guys,
So my father has an essential store and he gets this message on whatsapp saying that govt has launched a website to register your company as Suraksha Store so that they can get govt benefits.
Website: [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (very believable domain for the average non tech guy)
Here is what made me suspicious:
1. The website didn't open for me as I had high-security settings for chrome (ERR: Too many redirects)
2. No mention of website in any news
3. Powered by SafeJob at the end which is a private company
4. Copyright to suraksha circle (i.e. the circle that GOI has asked us to make where people will stand)
5. After filling the form, it asked us to get a certificate so that we can get approved faster and that certification needs us to login to their website [safejob.in](https://safejob.in) where we need to create account and do a suraksha certificate course
6. The course is a video where they explain how to make your store a suraksha store and then asks a basic quiz (which is a good deed they're doing acc. to me)
Here are my findings:
1. Terminal command I used:-  whois  [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (Only for tech guys)
2. The domain is being bought by Vineet Tiwari of Safeducate
3. There was no information that I could find linked to GOI
4. I checked socials of both safejob and safeducate (none of them have posted about it)
5. On website of safeducate, it says Ministry of rural development  but on surakshastore, it's ministry of home affairs (This might be against my hypothesis)
Link of whois result: [https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com](https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com&recaptchaResponse=03AHaCkAYKFQoubZUr1si98nAJnDn0VM5x5Z43VMMjUoyLO1OfY6lZsxqf1KTMRFuBsIi-l1TfdDBlHZ8lnGsQITNwXSt0vzgA9qzvXb0vT-855S7tRKA89dveP9obUN1_-4h7_BMwDaHKbO10AhbG4UDY6cgIKuESpGtZuoB0ButrjvBGiUqvDeaZ0rheIJiXAfst1Ur0jfVO2kLAyWXtK06gIqJ91T5GNjTbLLFxLxiJDlMY_Xw_Z13ms4xI2exVKuKWLsEF6CxdGASDWCqJFs6ZRmhX3i32QIYVxC0Q5n-p1qHW8r1-Q0KfTP3SML-_LYUisjC8ov5kzPWswqFk2fP3l_p5gNwCPxZ57_NWY6SPL4NO1zck4RvLec_PsHxBc3siRu0R1RArgdRwKA3YzlcyD_kvPxKpcQ)

Although I highly think this is a scam, I would want to ask you guys if you think otherwise and if you also find that this website is a scam, please notify your Whatsapp groups. (Lies circulate through WhatsApp, so let the truth tackle it there itself)
I'm open to any sources that prove that this is not a scam. If it is a scam, then you have to be the lowest of scums to make profit in these times scamming people.

It was a heated conversation. I did not provoke the other person. The other person threatened to kill me, and harm me, and hurt me violently. The person said this several times.

The situation is:   
the conversation was pertaining to something in location X.  
I reside in location Y, different state, some 300-400 km from location X.  
And the other person is currently in location Z, some 500+ km from both City X and City Y, and in a different state.  
The person clearly mentioned they would kill me in location X. also made a slight remark they would harm me in location Y.  
If I want to file a police complaint against the person for threatening to kill me,   
1. In which city police station should I file the complaint?
* Whether this is solid grounds to file this complaint? (threatening to kill me/harm me , over phone call.)
* Whether recording of phone call is admissible proof?
* Whether my phone would be kept in police custody?

Vodafone India TERRIBLE SERVICE,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g42eq3/vodafone_india_terrible_service/,53.0,Non-Political,68.0,g42eq3,praharshnbhatt,"I'm a Redx customer (Rs 999/mo), and Vodafone promises ""Unlimited internet"", with ""No max limit"" for this plan. I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.
I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.
Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!
I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!
I also tried and opened a case with resolver, wrote to their social media channels including Twitter, nowhere could I get any help.

But what I find more outrageous is their people have the guts to manipulate wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikhil_Kumar_(actor)  ) and phrase it as ""The wedding took place on April 17, 2020[9] near Janapada Loka in Ramanagara[10], but caused controversy as it was held during the extended Janata Curfew""
As far as I know, the janata curfew was voluntary and long back. On April 17, the lockdown and social-distancing was in full effect. But these folks are phrasing it on wiki so damn casually. As if the lockdown translates to janata curfew for VIPs.
Is no legal action being taken against these people for violating the lockdown so blatantly?

My sincere thought was and is still that - whatever desk jobs can be done through Work from home(WFH) should be done in that way without any loosening of screws - which the govt seems to be doing now. 

Especially for IT sector employees who are working from home and thereby not putting undue stress on a societal level even inadvertently - on their fellow colleagues, office staff, their own health, their near ones health and the greater population - especially for  them who are actually equipped to do WFH , why the rush to loosen up everything now as if after 20th April, Covid19 would magically disappear.

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.

YOU are in charge of your body.

India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/,121.0,Non-Political,218.0,g3mehq,kullky_2020,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",2020-04-19 1:30:47
Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3lncu/horlics_chocolate_powder_vs_cadbury_cocoa_powder/,23.0,Food,16.0,g3lncu,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

So I heard about Asur from Reddit where op praises the show, so checked IMDb, it had a rating of 8.7 so I decided to give it a shot.
Watched it within 2 days and was completely disappointed .
The show is full of plot holes some of these are,
* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.
*Oxygen chamber having timer instead of an oximeter. Also the clock speed up when hostages are idle but works Normal when they're trying to kill eachother where oxygen consumption is increased.

You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.

The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.

The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

Only thing which is good is the soundtrack.
A complete disappointment.

I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.

Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*",2020-04-18 21:17:29

IFFâs Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paperâs analysis of the partnership through the lens of whatâs good, possible risks and the projectâs relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.


Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the worldâs two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.


Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.


To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required. Â Similar to Singaporeâs *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFFâs Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every userâs device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance peopleâs privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu appâs own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their âclose proximityâ interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individualâs phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other personâs phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.


One of the large outcomes of the coronavirusâ impact in relation to peopleâs increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on peopleâs movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect peopleâs fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to peopleâs personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations. Â Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the projectâs first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions. Â Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.


It is important to highlight that Indiaâs Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFFâs submission will address the whitepaper/consultationâs interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

In the last few days, me and my family have had these curious nocturnal visitors. We initially thought they were some sort of wild cats.
We were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets. Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats. 
We now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen. We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap. I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there.
The animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere. Knowing my parents, they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear. Now, I need to know if I did it right. Did I ensure that the animal will have a new lease of life or only bought it some time?",2020-04-22 9:24:20

But situation as it is, COVID-19 means that I am now in a dilemma because of 2 reasons -
  
1. Most politicians and Economists agree that even after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the recession it has started will continue. Does this mean that this is not the best time to be graduating from a business school?
  
2. Due to ban on international travel laid down by most countries, I may not be able to travel and attend classes physically. Being able to immerse myself in a developed Aisan work culture and the ability to network with some.of the best students from all around ASIA is one of the reasons why I am persuing the degree and studying for online while living in India is not worth the money I'll be paying for the MBA for me.

2. On  Flipkart it says Lenovo y530 has an expandable ram up to 16GB whereas  strix g has 32GB expandable. So, ofcourse I want to buy a future proof  laptop and 32GB sounds way better than 16GB not gonna lie but I am not  sure even that much amount of ram will be useful.
3. Asus  rog strix g doesn't come with a camera. I usually don't use camera in  India but I am going to college outside India and I don't want to carry  an extra accessory with the already heavy laptop. So, I need a camera  inbuilt if at all possible. Lastly,

3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home

**Detailed Analysis**
**Beard Trimmer**
**Economy Segment**
[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349
Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings
Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched
Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi
**Premium Segment**
[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.
Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition
**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**
Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits
**Economy Segment**
[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299
Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings
5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb
No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great
**Premium Segment**
[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599
Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones
My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052
**Hair Clippers**
Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now
[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

A popular Ambedkarite journalist has said in a long post that the reason most of the freedom fighters were from upper caste because they were scared that British administration might break their status quo .,their ancestors never rebelled against Mughal or delhi sultanate.
In the entire Mughal history, most of upper caste had  tremendous respect and had acquired good positions in Mughal administration . Rajputs who are now flaunting swords must remember that they not only surrender their swords ,but also gave their daughters in Mughal harem in exchange of keeping their zamindari intact.

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 
Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.
Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.
But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.
Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?
Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!
P.S: I checked my own Aadhar card's authentication history anyway, just to confirm, and there are no records for any recent access.",2020-04-22 0:05:55

The numbers dont seem to be decreasing. Nor they are increasing dramatically.   
Both facts somewhat concern me, they should be decreasing right? we enforced lockdown to decrease spread. And we are planning on opening lockdowns when the numbers have not even started their downward trend!   
Also why the numbers are not increasing!? Is it because we are doing really less testing and the numbers that should be caught are not being caught. If we have the capacity to do more testing we would end up catching more people with the virus?  
Given our lockdown is not the most strictly enforced lockdown, the spread will keep happening. Argh, sometimes the situation seems quite hopeless! :/

Mob lynching of Muslims get a communal angle because the reason of their lynching is often religious (jihad, beef, or straight up Islamophobia).
The sadhus in Palghar got lynched (allegedly) because the people attacking them belived them to be child kidnappers/ thieves. They didn't got lynched because they were Hindu, atleast there isn't any proof of it.
So giving this incident a narrative of how Hindus are unsafe is just adding to the communal hate in the country",2020-04-21 21:38:19

He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.
His narrative is incredible.
This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.
Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?
I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.
Thoughts?
It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 
  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 
2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 
3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   
  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   
  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes. If it wasn't so time sensative, I could wait, but we are out of time for me to be super super patient.",2020-04-21 18:30:23

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.
Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 
After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.
Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.
After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.
TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.
Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad's healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.",2020-04-20 19:06:40

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.
A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 
Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.
>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.
>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).
>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?
>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.
>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!
So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 
Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   
I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing
>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.
She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.
Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 
>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.
>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.
>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.
>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.
â
>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.
>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.
â
>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.
>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!
NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)
I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.
Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.
As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 
Its called Syndicate.
In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.
After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.
Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]
Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.
Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",2020-04-19 22:52:34

The things you guys have done is just tremendous help for us. I never thought our fundraiser would get this much attention. I thank you all for the same.
I showed the wonderful comments and messages from you guys to my mother and she teared up seeing your beautiful messages. 
My father's stroke is severe and the funds raised from you guys have helped us to keep him under proper intensive care facility. The fundraiser has helped us a lot not to worry about money constantly. A week costs around 2 lacs in the hospital ICU. 
It's outrageous to ask for help this often but we are hopeless in this situation as I lost my job and there's no income source left. We are trying to sell our land so that the money will be helpful to us but due to the lockdown which is almost like the second demonatization the economy is down. 
I again request you all to consider sharing the fundraiser forward and donating whatever amount you are comfortable with. Again thank you so much for all the support you have given our family. Thanks very much.

I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.
I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.
Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!
I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!
I also tried and opened a case with resolver, wrote to their social media channels including Twitter, nowhere could I get any help.
My question is, what is the next better place could I open a case / get assistance from?",2020-04-19 19:10:34

India is a stark contrast compared the USA from what I've seen, but that has only made me want to travel there even more. I had some burning questions I would love some answers to. Besides some YouTubers and books, it can be hard to get some valuable information about traveling to India, as most Americans are baffled at the thought of me VOLUNTARILY wanting to go to India, and only think of it as a dirty and extremely poor 3rd world country without even researching the country.

1. Would you recommend doing a guided tour (even though they can be cheesy and touristic at times) for my first time in India or would it be doable to solo travel or travel with a few friends? I've heard India can be very overwhelming for foreigners at first, but I wanted to know your thoughts.
2. What are some safety tips that are actually TRUE and not stereotypical. I've heard about the poor water quality, Delhi belly (caution against street food), beggars, so HOT, not to walk outside at night, scammers on the street, dirty, filled with pollution, etc. but I want to know if there is any truth to any of this and what I can do to have a great experience.
3. What cities (and sights) would you most recommend for a first-timer in India if I were to travel there for 7-10 days? Where can I find the busiest and most chaotic streets in India (as this fascinates me, as in the USA the roads are very organized). What kind of budget would I need for 7-10 days?
4. Also just out of curiosity, what stereotypes of India or Indian people would you wish to disappear as they are not true?
5. What else can I do to best prepare for a trip to India?

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.

YOU are in charge of your body.

Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3lncu/horlics_chocolate_powder_vs_cadbury_cocoa_powder/,23.0,Food,17.0,g3lncu,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

All this, because the mother had adopted Christianity, that believes abortion is a crime. Hope it was worth it.

Need help regarding my career. Specifically MBA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g35581/need_help_regarding_my_career_specifically_mba/,22.0,AskIndia,12.0,g35581,para97k,"Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",2020-04-18 5:49:56
