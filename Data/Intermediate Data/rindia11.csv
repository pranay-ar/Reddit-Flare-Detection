In the last few days, me and my family have had these curious nocturnal visitors. We initially thought they were some sort of wild cats.

We were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets. Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats. 

We now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen. We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap. I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there.

The animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere. Knowing my parents, they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear. Now, I need to know if I did it right. Did I ensure that the animal will have a new lease of life or only bought it some time?",2020-04-22 09:24:20

But situation as it is, COVID-19 means that I am now in a dilemma because of 2 reasons -

  


1. Most politicians and Economists agree that even after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the recession it has started will continue. Does this mean that this is not the best time to be graduating from a business school?

  


2. Due to ban on international travel laid down by most countries, I may not be able to travel and attend classes physically. Being able to immerse myself in a developed Aisan work culture and the ability to network with some.of the best students from all around ASIA is one of the reasons why I am persuing the degree and studying for online while living in India is not worth the money I'll be paying for the MBA for me.

I have couple of questions and doubts.

1. The  strix g I am looking at comes with a 1TB HHD. Does it have M.2 SSD slot  as well so I can add one ssd later? Maybe I will go with a 512GB SSD if  the price drops a little bit.
2. On  Flipkart it says Lenovo y530 has an expandable ram up to 16GB whereas  strix g has 32GB expandable. So, ofcourse I want to buy a future proof  laptop and 32GB sounds way better than 16GB not gonna lie but I am not  sure even that much amount of ram will be useful.
3. Asus  rog strix g doesn't come with a camera. I usually don't use camera in  India but I am going to college outside India and I don't want to carry  an extra accessory with the already heavy laptop. So, I need a camera  inbuilt if at all possible. Lastly,
4. The battery, I don't know which has a better battery.

Which laptop would you suggest I should go for? Some input would be appreciated. Thank you!

As Covid 19 pandemic is thrashing the world economies, Indian stocks in the near future will be available at discounted prices and those who of us who had missed the boat during the 2008-09 recession can enter into the market this time. What are your thoughts?

Hey Everyone,

I am bored out of my mind. Since I have experience in the Personal Care Appliance industry, so thought of creating this post to help the first time trimmer buyers in Quarrantine. I have tested all of these products at one time or the other. This seems like a need for many of the people in the male demographic

Note : Only the products which are deliverable will be featured. Currently only Flipkart is delivering so I am only featuring Flipkart Products. Will edit this post later to include

**TLDR**

1. Beard Trimmer -

Economy Segment - [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Price - Rs.1349 . & [Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Price - Rs.1199

Premium Segment - [Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Price -Rs.1999

2. Full Body Grooming Kits -

Economy Segment - [Beardo Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) Price Rs.1299

Premium Segment - [Nova 1153 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3)\- Price Rs.1599

3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home

[Nova Hair Clipper](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) Price Rs 1295

**Detailed Analysis**

**Beard Trimmer**

**Economy Segment**

[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349

Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings

Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched

Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi

**Premium Segment**

[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.

Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition

**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**

Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits

**Economy Segment**

[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299

Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings

5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb

No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great

**Premium Segment**

[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599

Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones

My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052

**Hair Clippers**

Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now

[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

Unpopular opinion - lockdown extension was uncalled for,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g5djsa/unpopular_opinion_lockdown_extension_was_uncalled/,24,Policy/Economy,0,g5djsa,1587497488.0,Sefffaroque,"Unpopular opinion, I think this extreme lockdown extension  was uncalled for, ppl who support this extension are like “oh no 20 k ppl infected, 200 ppl have died, if we don’t stop this now by extending this lockdown, lacs of ppl will die!!, so stop cribbing and do your bit! ” 

For comparison in India, 50 lac ppl / children die every year to totally avoidable / curable maladies like typhoid, polio, child malnutrition etc etc 

Destroying an entire countries economy and causing the loss of livelihoods and inadvertently lives coz a few hundred / thousand  ppl who have some serious underlying conditions are gonna die  is not the smartest thing to do ( also over 90% are asymptotmatic as has been proved by Iceland which has conducted tests for like 20% of its population ; asymptotic meaning they don’t show any symptoms and go back to normal without even realizing) 

So again is this extreme step that has totally handicapped our country from ground up even worth it?? 

I mean I am sure soo many ppl would have died as a result of this lockdown itself, ppl who needed medical attention for some other ailment, ppl who couldn’t get their fix ( alcohol etch) ppl who lost their jobs their families and their minds (migrant workers getting screwed over anyone) 

I am not even including the multifold increase of ppl/ children  dying of the aforementioned maladies ( typhoid, polio, child malnutritionetc) that will surely increase by several multiples this year due to the lockdown itself. 

I think the entire thing is a fools errand and with every extension the returns are diminishing . 

As the reality is we might need to extend this lockdown till we get a vaccine in a country like India, as the lockdown by itself can’t curb this menace, and a vaccine might take two years at-least by the looks of it. 

So can we afford to go into an extended lockdown till then? I hope we don’t do that.",2020-04-22 01:01:28

A popular Ambedkarite journalist has said in a long post that the reason most of the freedom fighters were from upper caste because they were scared that British administration might break their status quo .,their ancestors never rebelled against Mughal or delhi sultanate.

In the entire Mughal history, most of upper caste had  tremendous respect and had acquired good positions in Mughal administration . Rajputs who are now flaunting swords must remember that they not only surrender their swords ,but also gave their daughters in Mughal harem in exchange of keeping their zamindari intact.

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 

Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.

Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.

But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.

Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?

Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!

P.S: I checked my own Aadhar card's authentication history anyway, just to confirm, and there are no records for any recent access.",2020-04-22 00:05:55

The numbers dont seem to be decreasing. Nor they are increasing dramatically.   
Both facts somewhat concern me, they should be decreasing right? we enforced lockdown to decrease spread. And we are planning on opening lockdowns when the numbers have not even started their downward trend!   
Also why the numbers are not increasing!? Is it because we are doing really less testing and the numbers that should be caught are not being caught. If we have the capacity to do more testing we would end up catching more people with the virus?  


Given our lockdown is not the most strictly enforced lockdown, the spread will keep happening. Argh, sometimes the situation seems quite hopeless! :/

### Tl;dr

On 31 March, the Foundation for Media Professionals filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis. During the first hearing on 9 April, the Court issued notice to the Standing Counsel for Government of Jammu & Kashmir. The matter was listed again today i.e. 21 April and the Court directed the Government to file a reply to the petition by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March. The petition was first listed for hearing before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J on 9 April. During the hearing on 9 April, the bench issued notice to the Standing Counsel of Government of Jammu & Kashmir. Read more about the petition and last hearing [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-issues-notice-in-fmps-petition-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-jammu-kashmir-during-covid-19-crisis/).

Subsequent to the petition being filed on 31 March, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir continued to direct ISPs to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G through orders issued under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. These orders issued on 3 April and 15 April were also challenged by the Petitioner by filing additional applications. 

### Practical Impact of the Internet Slowdown

In addition to challenging subsequent internet slowdown orders, the Petitioner also sought to bring on record personal narratives of hardships faced by doctors, teachers, students, journalists, advocates etc in Jammu & Kashmir due to the internet slowdown. FMP’s Director and veteran journalist, Ms. Revati Laul personally spoke to 13 residents of Jammu & Kashmir to collect these narratives.

>*“I have so many patients who are just able to call me this time. I can’t understand what they are trying to tell me exactly...One said,I have pain in the tummy. The tummy is big. It has around 20 organs inside. So then I ask – is it the upper part of the tummy, is it the right side, is it lower? And it becomes very difficult. It’s not possible to accurately pin-point what they’re saying.”* \-Doctor at Srinagar Government Medical College on need for video facilities  
>  
>*“The universities will hold their exams on time. Then no one will speak on our behalf to say to them – oh, there was no 4G, there were no classes. There will only be exams. Did we get any education? Are teachers being sent to our homes? Is there a door to door drive to ensure that students’ education won’t be affected?""* \- Student at Degree College in Bemina

The Petitioner also produced a comparative analysis of web performance at 2G and 4G speed to help the Court fully understand the practical consequences of the internet slowdown. This technical report was authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre, a technologist and policy researcher who had previously also analysed functionality of whitelisted websites in Jammu & Kashmir. The analysis revealed that tasks on observed 2G speed can take upto 50 times longer and 2G network conditions were well below the minimum requirements of video streaming/video communication platforms like YouTube, Zoom and Skype. In addition to this theoretical analysis, Mr. Waghre also carried out a simulated test which found that some interactive interfaces like the World Health Organization’s Situation Tracker did not function at observed 2G speeds at all. 

### What happened at today’s hearing?

During today’s hearing, the bench inquired about a suo moto petition pending before the Jammu & Kashmir High Court on the same issue. In response to this, the Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta indicated that he requires time to seek more information about the suo moto petition and suggested that it may also be transferred to the Supreme Court. 

The Court also sought information about the total number of COVID-19 cases in Jammu & Kashmir. Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for FMP informed the Court that the region had 354 COVID-19 cases. He emphasized that this was a matter of grave urgency and the Government had not filed its response despite notice being issued on 9 April. Therefore, he requested the Court to direct the Government to file its reply expeditiously.

The Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal sought to justify the internet slowdown by claiming that the region had a serious militancy problem. However, the bench directed the Government to file a proper written response and record its submissions on affidavit. The Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta accepted this direction and indicated that the Government will file a consolidated report. 

In addition to FMP’s petition, two more petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services filed by Soayib Quereshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir were also listed for hearing today. Advocate Charu Ambwani representing the Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir highlighted how the education of 27 lakh students was being hampered because they did not have access to high speed internet. In response to a question by the bench, she also stated that most students in Jammu & Kashmir have laptops and tablets so the biggest hurdle is slow internet speed. 

After hearing submissions made by all counsels, the bench directed the Government to file a reply by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April.

I am totally open to making any changes to the newsletter to keep it more impactful to the readers. I spend about 2-3 hours on this every day. So, please feel free to suggest any feedback if you have, mainly in terms of the categories, types of news stories and suggestions on sources to follow.

He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.

His narrative is incredible.

This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.

Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?

I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.

Thoughts?

It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes.

I do not know how to make a funding website to donate money. But someone should collect the money and give it to Missionaries of Charity or other NGOs to help them.

Since we have so many members, I guess we should donate at least 11crs in total.

"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4s5yd/indian_govt_banning_investment_from_china_is_yet/,12,Policy/Economy,0,g4s5yd,1587415734.0,ShortTesla_Rekt5,"Modi is on a killing spree. After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 

China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 


After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 



Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 

2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 

3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?


Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the ""ban button"" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi's favourite, for all situations.",2020-04-21 02:18:54

India and UAE share the values  of non-discrimination on any grounds, the Indian ambassador to the  country tweeted on Monday amid growing resentment in the Arab world over  reports of Muslims being targeted in India over the coronavirus  pandemic.

""**India and UAE share the value of non-discrimination on  any grounds. Discrimination is against our moral fabric and the Rule of  law. Indian nationals in the UAE should always remember this**,""  Ambassador Pavan Kapoor.

He quoted a tweet by Prime Minister  Narendra Modi in which he had said, ""COVID-19 does not see race,  religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking. Our  response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and  brotherhood. We are in this together.""

The  tweets come after a backlash in Arab countries, including UAE and  Kuwait, over instances of Muslims being targeted in India amid the  COVID-19 crisis.

The Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission  (IPHRC) of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the  federation of 57 Muslim nations, on Sunday had tweeted:

Several  Twitter users in Arab nations, including a member of UAE's royal family  have expressed their dismay at the vilification of Muslims in India  since a congregation hosted last month by Islamic missionary group  Tablighi Jamaat emerged as the biggest cluster of coronavirus cases in  the country.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday [had spoken out against any form of discrimination](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-covid-19-does-not-see-race-religion-caste-before-striking-2214518), saying the COVID-19 pandemic affects everyone equally.

The  Prime Minister's post came on a day when a police case was filed  against a hospital in Uttar Pradesh after it placed an ad in local  papers that it would admit Muslim patients only after COVID-19  screening.

Earlier this month, the Indian government had said that [certain communities and neighbourhoods are being vilified](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-covid-19-do-not-target-any-community-area-for-spread-of-coronavirus-says-centre-2208542)  based on false reports floating on social media and elsewhere, issuing  an advisory to address the social stigma and discrimination surrounding  the COVID-19 pandemic.

The advisory asked people not to spread on  social media the names, identity or the locality of those affected by  the virus or under quarantine. It also urged people to avoid spreading  fear and panic.

The advisory came after a spurt in coronavirus  cases following a religious congregation organised by the Tablighi  Jamaat at its Markaz or headquarters in Delhi's Nizamuddin area, and  instances of people blaming the Muslim community for the spread of the  disease.",2020-04-21 06:20:38

I've used various earphone but all of them are budget around 1.2k max. I've used boat bassheads 225, Cowon EM1, 1More Piston, CX180, Leaf Sport Wireless, Boat rockers 225 wireless, Mivi thunderbeats. I am very rough user. (I don't like wireless because of sound delay)

Listen to Artist Like Avicii, SHM, Sasha Solan, Julia Michales, Lauv, Annie Marie, Phobe Ryan, Sufijan Steven, B Praak, Anuv Jain, Jasleen Royal, Prateek Kuhad, Goher Mumtaz. I earlier used to listen EDM more so it would be better if you can also keep in mind that.

Pricing of Electronic Products in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4vp81/pricing_of_electronic_products_in_india/,6,AskIndia,10,g4vp81,1587428056.0,Av_Inash,"I wanted to know how does pricing and the associated components to it actually work in India. This is in context to the recent launch of the iPhone SE and the OnePlus 8 models. The iPhone SE is launched at $399 which translates to around Rs.30000. On the other hand the OnePlus pricing started at $699 which translates to around Rs.54000.

However by the time these products actually come to India the iPhone SE is actually somewhere around Rs.42000. On the other hand, OnePlus is able to launch its phones in India at a lower price - Rs 42000 in comparison to the starting Rs. 54000. How is this possible? Are the custom & GST rules different for companies based out of different countries? Or is there a different angle or dynamic to it?",2020-04-21 05:44:16

It's already been 27 days & counting, the people have been abiding the PM and doing their bit. But how long can one be expected to survive solely on food & water.

Opening shops all over doesn't help prevention of the spread of the virus. E-commerce seems to be the only viable option for now. But the CAIT (confederation of All India Traders) wants a level playing field. 

In times like this, is competition more important than getting (& helping) the people stuck in their home what they NEED!

I was wondering if you all will indulge me and write down the TV show timings that you remember. If you have a specific TV channel or TV events in your head associated with a certain time of the day, that would be awesome too! (For example, AXN means late nights as that was the only time I could watch it without parents noticing, Formula 1 invokes weekend afternoons, Early mornings mean India-Australia test matches, Star TV reminds me of 9-11 PM when my whole family would watch it). I am not interested in the accuracy of the timings (as memories can be imperfect) but I am wondering what specific associations and memories y'all have. I hope some of you find it an interesting exercise and thank you for your time!",2020-04-20 23:53:22

He spent his last days fasting for a clean Ganga in 2018. He died after 112 days.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prof. G. D. Agarwal, alma mater IIT Roorkee UC Berkeley, died from a fast-unto-death to protest against environmentally destructive projects on Ganga and Bhagirathi .

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._D._Agrawal#2018

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/12/indian-environmental-activist-fasts-death-over-fate-indias-ganges-river/

He was extremely vocal against illegal river sand mining.

Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 

With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.

I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.

Why do you think mainstream media wants us to focus on Timur ?

Shame on each and every Indian for not knowing about him and his life struggle when he was alive and fighting on our behalf.",2020-04-20 23:00:06

Some use this as a tactic for extorting money from helpless and desperate victims.

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.

TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.
Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad's healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.",2020-04-20 19:06:40

People from households with income more than 10,000 per month have to pay some amounts (with some subsidies depending on income) for testing and should be tested at private labs only.

People in the bracket 10,000 pm to 20,000 pm aren’t exactly well-off either they should pay ₹500 per test.

People in the bracket 20,000 -50,000 can pay in 1000s, therefore, they should pay ₹2,500 per test.

People in the bracket 50,000 - 100,000 are pretty well off and should pay ₹4,500 per test.

People earning above ₹1 lakh per month should pay ₹5,000 per test. 

And people earning above ₹2 lakh per month should pay ₹6,500 per test.

The point of well earning people paying more is that they’d be able to fund Indian based manufacturers to boost their production of rapid-testing kits and also the number of private labs. Government bidding test kits from foreign countries should have separate budget, as usual. 

As of now, almost all Indian based companies are planning to keep the cost below ₹2,000

Assuming we’ve got 650,000 test kits from China 3 days ago with some stocks and  two of our local companies HLL and Voxtur that have begun production and expect to produce 100,000 by the end of the week. With more fundings they should be able to meet or even surpass the foreign bought rapid test kits in production units.

why are so many indians and sri lankans so arrogant?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4i22d/why_are_so_many_indians_and_sri_lankans_so/,7,AskIndia,6,g4i22d,1587368611.0,Rimbaud33,"I know they're not the same but i will just say india instead of saying ""India and sri lanka"" every single time because india is more relevant to my subjective experience and because of simplicity, so im not meaning to offend anybody but i've met people from both bakcgrounds and i like and respect their culture but i've noticed something that i usually ignore unitl it's just too annoying

&#x200B;

So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).

Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.

&#x200B;

Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.

&#x200B;

I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?

&#x200B;

Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.

&#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.

&#x200B;

I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online

&#x200B;

it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?

&#x200B;

I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?

&#x200B;

Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?

&#x200B;

do indian people live in denial?

&#x200B;

or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?

&#x200B;

the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay

&#x200B;

I just don't get it

&#x200B;

what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?

I'd like to know what you guys think :)

&#x200B;

edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong. 

Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics, not always, of course, i'm not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality, but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience.

I hope i didn't offend anyone because i am genuinely interested in this, i like indian food, folklore, art and philosophy i am personally inclined to buddhism :) ",2020-04-20 13:13:31

From what I know, the drug has side-effects and it's efficacy has been contested in several clinical trials. The article mentions that the initial plan of testing 50,000 people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study.


As a layman, I had the following questions:


- What are the possible side-effects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions?



- Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions (quality of water, sanitation etc.), is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely? What implications does it have for the results of the experiment, even if it's carried out as planned? (Link to study for this claim [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141369/))



- Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past? From what I know, such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale.



- Thoughts about notion of informed consent for this study under these conditions?

> 
> During January 26–February 10, 2020, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters. The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation.

r/COVID19 post: https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g3sgcf/covid19_outbreak_associated_with_air_conditioning/

Personally I think we need to give importance to the fact that there are summer viruses and winter viruses and they need different combinations of temperature+humidity.

Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/transmission/

> Humidity (best if between 50% and 80%)
> 
> ""It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane"" [source] Relative humidity (RH, or Saturation Ratio: the state of vapor equilibrium in room air) affects all infectious droplets with respiratory viruses, independent of their source (respiratory tract or aerosolized from any fluid) and location (in air or settled on surfaces). Relative humidity therefore affects all transmission ways but has the most pronounced effect on airborne transmission. [source]
> 
> ""Measurements of indoor humidities in 40 residential apartments in New York (19) and in 6 high-quality commercial buildings in the Midwest (20) showed indoor vapor pressure of below 10 mb or indoor RH of below 24% in the winter"" [source]
> 
> Experiments conducted in a study indicated ""a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH (20–50%), while the stability of summer or all-year viruses enhanced at higher RH (80%)"" [source]

Therefore, while our population size, education/awareness and density are strong disadvantages to us, **maybe** there is some advantage to be had if we **stop using air-conditioning entirely for the duration of the pandemic wherever possible**. 

This is speculation, but I believe **it merits proper investigation**.

Alternative credit score & Automating the Entire process to reduce the Turn around time of loans into seconds

I want to solve this problems 

- In India, Just 35 millions pay Income tax out of 130 millions. Here credit underwriting model uses credit bureau data, Bank statements, Income tax returns.  So, 97% people are not accessed to formal credit. Still they borrow from the loan mafia & they charge exorbitant interest rates. There is need for alternative credit assessment, by using smartphone data & using social security numbers. 

- The Turn around time for the loans is 7 days to 3 Months. While the world battles issues centering around data privacy and consent, the Account Aggregator & Indian stack will allow both individuals and businesses to share their financial data in digital form with third parties in a safe manner. 

- Credit Risk - Risky Business 
 
Predicting the risk of customer credit default. How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. 

Unlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer. By applying advances in machine learning we can able to radically outperform traditional scorecards in both consumer and small business lending. 

By building models on more than simple default, and focusing on such outcomes as profitability and customer lifetime value, we allow you to fully leverage artificial intelligence to increase your lending performance. 

- Ample computing power and digital data are the fuel for machine learning, of course. The more data and the more iterations the algorithmic engine goes through, the better its output gets. Data scientists come up with probabilistic prediction models for specific actions, and then the algorithm churns through loads of data to produce better decisions in real time with every iteration. These prediction models become the basis for most business decisions.

- we applied for Account aggregator license from Reserve bank of India, we get all public data like Banking, Mutual funds, insurance etc. we are in the process building the consortium to share non financial data.

- By Automating the entire process &  building the algorithms using supervised learning, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, Experimenting & building software stack. I hope we can solve this problem. 

- current credit bureau has many flaws like their algorithm is  blatantly opaque, they don’t use real time data, their business model itself skeptical. 

- So, we want to start a platform which can adds value to the both lenders & borrowers.

- We are looking for AI, ML engineers, data scientists who can build probabilistic models, blockchain enthusiasts,Front end designers for building the application & app.

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 


###Dilip Ghosh, BJP

Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   

###Mamata Banerjee, TMC

I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",2020-04-19 22:52:34

What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g43omc/what_ht_wouldnt_publish_the_folly_and_vanity_of/,3,Policy/Economy,16,g43omc,1587310658.0,bob_semple_,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)

Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  

*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 

In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhi’s Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: “Why is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capital’s catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?”

In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores “on a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhi’s pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the people’s good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.”

The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishore’s article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firm’s previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their execution  “upon the removal of  “obstacles” like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practices”. The firm’s past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting “an innate disrespect for the  citizen”.

In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:

“The biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs Elysées? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: ‘It brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayer’s expense.”

Kishore’s essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.

In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.

Also read: [In Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Central Vista Project Should Be Reviewed](https://thewire.in/urban/covid-19-central-vista-project-new-delhi)

The prime minister’s own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone – the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldn’t quite do  for Narendra Modi.

To my mind, the Modi government’s redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  ruler’s immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean Bédel-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaul’s essay ‘[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)’).

Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  

As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why can’t the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme – estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting – be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?

Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money – not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year – probably longer – before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.

In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice – sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.

*Postscript: While spiking this particular article, the* Hindustan Times  *left open the possibility of my continuing to write on other (and  presumably from the paper’s point of view safer) subjects. I have  however chosen to discontinue my column in the newspaper.*",2020-04-19 21:07:38

It's outrageous to ask for help this often but we are hopeless in this situation as I lost my job and there's no income source left. We are trying to sell our land so that the money will be helpful to us but due to the lockdown which is almost like the second demonatization the economy is down.

Scamming people to sign up to their platform using the name of SURAKSHA STORE ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3z60v/scamming_people_to_sign_up_to_their_platform/,1,Coronavirus,12,g3z60v,1587288664.0,regover,"Hi guys,

So my father has an essential store and he gets this message on whatsapp saying that govt has launched a website to register your company as Suraksha Store so that they can get govt benefits.

Website: [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (very believable domain for the average non tech guy)

Here is what made me suspicious:

1. The website didn't open for me as I had high-security settings for chrome (ERR: Too many redirects)
2. No mention of website in any news
3. Powered by SafeJob at the end which is a private company
4. Copyright to suraksha circle (i.e. the circle that GOI has asked us to make where people will stand)
5. After filling the form, it asked us to get a certificate so that we can get approved faster and that certification needs us to login to their website [safejob.in](https://safejob.in) where we need to create account and do a suraksha certificate course
6. The course is a video where they explain how to make your store a suraksha store and then asks a basic quiz (which is a good deed they're doing acc. to me)

Here are my findings:

1. Terminal command I used:-  whois  [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (Only for tech guys)
2. The domain is being bought by Vineet Tiwari of Safeducate
3. There was no information that I could find linked to GOI
4. I checked socials of both safejob and safeducate (none of them have posted about it)
5. On website of safeducate, it says Ministry of rural development  but on surakshastore, it's ministry of home affairs (This might be against my hypothesis)

Link of whois result: [https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com](https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com&recaptchaResponse=03AHaCkAYKFQoubZUr1si98nAJnDn0VM5x5Z43VMMjUoyLO1OfY6lZsxqf1KTMRFuBsIi-l1TfdDBlHZ8lnGsQITNwXSt0vzgA9qzvXb0vT-855S7tRKA89dveP9obUN1_-4h7_BMwDaHKbO10AhbG4UDY6cgIKuESpGtZuoB0ButrjvBGiUqvDeaZ0rheIJiXAfst1Ur0jfVO2kLAyWXtK06gIqJ91T5GNjTbLLFxLxiJDlMY_Xw_Z13ms4xI2exVKuKWLsEF6CxdGASDWCqJFs6ZRmhX3i32QIYVxC0Q5n-p1qHW8r1-Q0KfTP3SML-_LYUisjC8ov5kzPWswqFk2fP3l_p5gNwCPxZ57_NWY6SPL4NO1zck4RvLec_PsHxBc3siRu0R1RArgdRwKA3YzlcyD_kvPxKpcQ)

(Link cut off in the text as was too long , don't copy-paste text please)

Although I highly think this is a scam, I would want to ask you guys if you think otherwise and if you also find that this website is a scam, please notify your Whatsapp groups. (Lies circulate through WhatsApp, so let the truth tackle it there itself)

I'm open to any sources that prove that this is not a scam. If it is a scam, then you have to be the lowest of scums to make profit in these times scamming people.

&#x200B;

PS A request please, let's not blame any political party/group until we have concrete evidence (no, photo with any party isn't concrete, investments of a party in the company is)  that they're involved as I don't want this to become a political thread.",2020-04-19 15:01:04

Need help! Someone threatened to kill me.

It was a heated conversation. I did not provoke the other person. The other person threatened to kill me, and harm me, and hurt me violently. The person said this several times. I have the call recorded.   

The situation is:   

the conversation was pertaining to something in location X.  
I reside in location Y, different state, some 300-400 km from location X.  
And the other person is currently in location Z, some 500+ km from both City X and City Y, and in a different state.  
The person clearly mentioned they would kill me in location X. also made a slight remark they would harm me in location Y.  

If I want to file a police complaint against the person for threatening to kill me,   

1. In which city police station should I file the complaint?
* Whether this is solid grounds to file this complaint? (threatening to kill me/harm me , over phone call.)
* Whether recording of phone call is admissible proof?
* Whether my phone would be kept in police custody?

I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.

I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.

Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!

I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!

I also tried and opened a case with resolver, wrote to their social media channels including Twitter, nowhere could I get any help.

But what I find more outrageous is their people have the guts to manipulate wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikhil_Kumar_(actor)  ) and phrase it as ""The wedding took place on April 17, 2020[9] near Janapada Loka in Ramanagara[10], but caused controversy as it was held during the extended Janata Curfew""

As far as I know, the janata curfew was voluntary and long back. On April 17, the lockdown and social-distancing was in full effect. But these folks are phrasing it on wiki so damn casually. As if the lockdown translates to janata curfew for VIPs.

Is no legal action being taken against these people for violating the lockdown so blatantly?
If there are any wiki editors here, hopefully they have the good sense to fix the phrasing in the page I linked to.",2020-04-19 17:27:17

I am designing a software to help physios save some time, while impacting their income positively. I need some data for that. Please help me with some questions. The following questions are not specific to your practice, but generally about physiotherapy in India.
 
Generally, how many sessions does a person need for his rehab?

What % of patients leave their therapy incomplete?

What would be the reasons for a patient to leave their therapy incomplete?

Generally how much more do home visits cost as compared to patient visiting the clinic?

Do physiotherapy patients have a waiting time at clinic? If yes, what would be the approximate time that patients need to wait for?

What other challenges do patients face in regards to their physiotherapy?

What are the challenges that physios face in their day to day business operations?

How often do physios have to work with multiple patients at one time?

How often do physios have to stretch their schedules/work hours because of excess patients?

How often do physios themselves face occupational hazards like back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain due to manual work or physically demanding sessions?

How many maximum sessions can an average physiotherapist do in a month? I am trying to understand the income ceiling of an average physio.

What are the fixed expenses per month of an average physio?

What are the ways that an average physio uses to cross the monthly income ceiling?",2020-04-19 17:25:28

India is a stark contrast compared the USA from what I've seen, but that has only made me want to travel there even more. I had some burning questions I would love some answers to. Besides some YouTubers and books, it can be hard to get some valuable information about traveling to India, as most Americans are baffled at the thought of me VOLUNTARILY wanting to go to India, and only think of it as a dirty and extremely poor 3rd world country without even researching the country.

1. Would you recommend doing a guided tour (even though they can be cheesy and touristic at times) for my first time in India or would it be doable to solo travel or travel with a few friends? I've heard India can be very overwhelming for foreigners at first, but I wanted to know your thoughts.
2. What are some safety tips that are actually TRUE and not stereotypical. I've heard about the poor water quality, Delhi belly (caution against street food), beggars, so HOT, not to walk outside at night, scammers on the street, dirty, filled with pollution, etc. but I want to know if there is any truth to any of this and what I can do to have a great experience.
3. What cities (and sights) would you most recommend for a first-timer in India if I were to travel there for 7-10 days? Where can I find the busiest and most chaotic streets in India (as this fascinates me, as in the USA the roads are very organized). What kind of budget would I need for 7-10 days?
4. Also just out of curiosity, what stereotypes of India or Indian people would you wish to disappear as they are not true?
5. What else can I do to best prepare for a trip to India?

Any information, suggestions, tips, or advice would be greatly appreciated!",2020-04-19 11:53:54

A dilemma,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3ry8v/a_dilemma/,2,AskIndia,1,g3ry8v,1587261862.0,aclulmpg," I know There are similar posts right now on this topic but i am posting this here because i have  asked this  question on Quora and I haven't gotten any answer.I hope I can get an answer on this site.       
 
  So this is about my brother who is an assistant manager in a PSU (public sector undertaking).Its a good secure job but there is a strong  chance  that this company might be privatised within 10 years.After passing out from his college my brother  was placed in an IT Company but he didn't  take that  up  because he wanted a secure govt. job.His CGPA is 8.2 and gre score  is 334 so he is very sure he will  get admission to a tier 1 university.   

His first problem is that he is a EC (electronics and communication)graduate and doesn't have much knowledge of computer science and doesn't have any significant coding experience.The only  language he knows is C++.  So he is concerned whether he will be able to cope up acdemically.
 The second (possible) obstacle is his age.He is almost 30 years old now and by the time he will have completed his MS he will be 32.Will this be a problem in getting a job in the US?( he doesn't want a job in India)
  
Our third concern is the current scenario in US with the coronavirus and possible  changes to the H1b visa process.Will this affect his chances  ?  
.Is it worth risking a secure  job for this opportunity?is it feasible?",2020-04-19 07:34:22

My sincere thought was and is still that - whatever desk jobs can be done through Work from home(WFH) should be done in that way without any loosening of screws - which the govt seems to be doing now. 

Especially for IT sector employees who are working from home and thereby not putting undue stress on a societal level even inadvertently - on their fellow colleagues, office staff, their own health, their near ones health and the greater population - especially for  them who are actually equipped to do WFH , why the rush to loosen up everything now as if after 20th April, Covid19 would magically disappear.

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.

YOU are in charge of your body.

"TIL that in UP and Bihar, almost six out of ten deaths were not registered in the death statistics (based on the latest available CRS data from 2017)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3n6wq/til_that_in_up_and_bihar_almost_six_out_of_ten/,0,Coronavirus,11,g3n6wq,1587243885.0,jai_ho_kick,"  
TL;DR, India lacks systematic registration of deaths even in the absence of the current pandemic. It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.

  
There have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India's success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.

Today, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).

I was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):

1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).
2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.

Moreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The ""cause of death"" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))

Given these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. 

These are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths.",2020-04-19 02:34:45

India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/,121,Non-Political,218,g3mehq,1587240047.0,kullky_2020,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",2020-04-19 01:30:47

Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3lncu/horlics_chocolate_powder_vs_cadbury_cocoa_powder/,23,Food,17,g3lncu,1587235850.0,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

So I heard about Asur from Reddit where op praises the show, so checked IMDb, it had a rating of 8.7 so I decided to give it a shot.
Watched it within 2 days and was completely disappointed .
The show is full of plot holes some of these are,
* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.
*Oxygen chamber having timer instead of an oximeter. Also the clock speed up when hostages are idle but works Normal when they're trying to kill eachother where oxygen consumption is increased.

You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.

The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.

The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

Only thing which is good is the soundtrack.
A complete disappointment.

My rating 6.5/10.",2020-04-18 22:28:49

I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.

Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*",2020-04-18 21:17:29

Mom being inherently biased against muslims. Help me change her views.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3fogm/mom_being_inherently_biased_against_muslims_help/,26,AskIndia,0,g3fogm,1587204950.0,NewThrowaway543210,"To give it a bit of context (She stays with dad in a tier 3 city with no contact to anyone apart from work friends, I live in a tier 1 city because of job)

I recently had an argument with my Mom, about the role of muslims in the recent covid 19 spread in India. I said I'm not disagreeing that certain groups of the muslim community are solely responsible for a massive spike in infections, but the tone that you are implying means that you had a problem with muslims long before this covid infection started.

Upon hearing this, she went full defensive mode, saying muslims are responsible for all the wars with India and they are responsible for every atrocity in India. I asked how many muslims have you spoken to in your life ?  She said she knows about Pakistan and the wars and that is enough. She said they are ""abishwas jati""

Our argument heated up and now I'm here asking what do I do to change her opinion that all muslims aren't ""Pakistani"" and aren't out to destroy the world. Media doesn't portray muslim in good light and it has led to years of indoctrination with older people who have no other contact other than media. But I am not saying I am apologising for muslims. I am an atheist and consider all religions to be irrelevant, islam to be the most if I had to draw a priority chart.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  One more point, To make matters worse, when Italy was #1 in covid infections, I found she was googling, ""how many muslims are there in Italy"". It was both hilarious and sad that she drew causality vs correlation, though that argument would have failed as well as Italy is not a muslim majority country.",2020-04-18 15:45:50

### Tl; dr

IFF’s Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper’s analysis of the partnership through the lens of what’s good, possible risks and the project’s relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.

### Background | The Promise of Scale and Privacy

Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world’s two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.

### Proposed Timelines

Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.

### The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy

To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required.  Similar to Singapore’s *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFF’s Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user’s device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people’s privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu app’s own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their “close proximity” interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual’s phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person’s phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.

### Risks Arising from the Project

One of the large outcomes of the coronavirus’ impact in relation to people’s increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people’s movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people’s fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people’s personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations.  Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project’s first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions.  Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.

### Relevance for India and What’s Next?

It is important to highlight that India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF’s submission will address the whitepaper/consultation’s interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",2020-04-18 05:49:56
