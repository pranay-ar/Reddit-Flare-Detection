Fuck all Religion,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,4195,Politics,17880,f9outu,1582726249.0,pking3,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

**Background Reading**

* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

Further studies in case you are interested.

[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 

[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 µg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 µg/kg and 8.3 µg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 

Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.

edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.

To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.

edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.

I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.

Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM."

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Edit: Guys please, if something here offends you then please let me know, but please do not downvote this, we dont want her to be remembered this way, we want to get the true story out.

Only 13 out of 1000 marriages result in a divorce in India. 
It could be due to arranged marriages, society pressure and the stigma attached to it. Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence. 

Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages. Failed marriage is not the same as a divorce. Just the absence of divorce doesn’t mean all is well."

I turn on Indian news channels and everyone says ""we always wanted peace, Pakistan doesn't want peace"". 
The media is clearly not truthful on either sides and have been manipulating citizens of both countries for years. 
I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.
We all watch cricket together and recently when India and Pakistan were versing each other we were all having a great time.
Politics and media has ruined us.

My father suffered a near fatal stroke and his recovery has been slow. We took discharge from the hospital and due to the rising cases of covid-19 and also the doctor suggested to take him home. 

But the fate was not on our side. He started coughing a little bit and had fever. We were still feeding him from feeding tube. Today his health was a little bit down so we decided to take him to the hospital and they screened all of us for Covid-19 due to the symptoms. Fortunately we all are negative. 

In the x-ray,it's showing that his left lung has collapsed completely. These last 2 months have really been awful for us especially for my mother as she isn't really coping well. 

The doctors have suggested there may be pneumonia or positional collapse involved in this case. 
Our family really is in dire need of your help. 

I beg you to contribute whatever you are comfortable with to the fundraiser. Please, we need your help and support. 

[Help my father recover](https://milaap.org/fundraisers/support-pawan-lonare?utm_source=shorturl)

Edit: Thiis is so overwhelming. Thanks for the awards. I'm sure with them the post visibility will increase and get us to the fundraiser amount in no time. Thank you each and everyone so tremendously. Thank you so much.

****EDIT****
I understand and agree with what most people say regarding BJP still winning national elections if held today. But imagine a scenario where both National and State governments controlled by 1 party. That will be scary."

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

&#x200B;

Swiggy, zomato etc - complete garbage. They take the payment but take 0 real responsiblity for what is delivered. Have had 500 rs orders only half delivered, and they refuse to replace or refund giving me a 50 rupee coupon for 250 rupees worth of missing items. Like what the fuck is that? If I wanted to just give away money id stand on a bridge and throw it.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

Cops: useless 100%, show they are advanced with twitter, facebook and incident report apps, 0% response rate (tried to report noise level issue in my area from a nearby construction site, over 30 complaints over 2 months, tweets, facebook messages, no response. One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

My relatives visited me. And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty. (Re-posting because violated some rules earlier),https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/87f85p/my_relatives_visited_me_and_i_live_with_my/,639,Non-Political,2581,87f85p,1522149270.0,,"Backstory: Last week I broke my ankle and there's a cast around it.  
And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

Also my mom told me last night that she got a call from everyone saying  ""*Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. Iski shaadi karado.*"""

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans.

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

* Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Coupled with NRC, CAA will create a hostile environment for Indian Muslims where they will be at the complete mercy of the government."

Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e69fln/possible_scam_on_the_huge_youtube_tech_channel/,313,AskIndia,2381,e69fln,1575537226.0,javapyscript,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today. 
https://imgur.com/a/7VJhBfP 

Thank you so much r/india for all the support in making this happen. All your comments here and on Twitter(and on YouTube too) made it possible for me to finally get the phone. Proud of the community. Thank you :)"

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

I could do all these as I was using office address, whose entry was heavily regulated under STPI laws. **It is 10 years now, but I have been told to never talk about this to anyone, else I may get killed.** Crazy."

People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,138,[R]eddiquette,2262,ar504q,1550318054.0,askquestionsdude,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 

>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

>“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

Does my period really makes me impure?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b0gd70/does_my_period_really_makes_me_impure/,851,AskIndia,2263,b0gd70,1552471220.0,,"I despise my periods not because they hurt me, but because of the amount of crappy rules I'm made to follow. It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days. Sounds like a punishment for eating. 2 days doing nothing looking at walls. That disgusts me a lot I feel like a wasted body or something."

I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,462,Non-Political,2228,ciddbn,1564232122.0,fuckyallmat,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

Who on earth is sitting on their couch and thinking ""oh man, I hope what the celebrities are upto"".
I can understand if this is a one time thing..but this is everyday. And now there is a program dedicated to what celebrities think about the virus and lockdown.
Shouldn't we be asking the doctors instead of the celebrities regarding this ? What do the celebrities know about this ?
Anyways I had to vent out. This seems ridiculous to me ( in my opinion ).  In times like these, I would probably care more about the recent developments than what celebs think. Anyways, stay safe."

Traffic was insane, I was tired, and there were a ton of people in the street. When my Uber arrived, I looked around and realized the super nice, noise canceling headphones I bought before I left the U.S. were gone. I probably got distracted and someone picked them up when I wasn't looking. I was angry at myself for being dumb. I've since been pricing new headphones.

Last night, I got done at the gym and went to the supermarket next to the gym to grab some food. After checking out, the cashier pulled me over to the side of the store and took my headphones out from a cubby by the counter. He saw me drop them nearly 2 weeks ago and grabbed them for me. I'm completely shocked, grateful, and appreciative as this would be a highly unlikely scenario in the U.S. Living/working in India has already been an amazing experience and this only makes it better."

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India.

My father forced me to join mechanical engineering with copious amount of sharma ji ka beta dialogues. after scoring a 0 in math test I dropped out . Next year I joined a bsc course and dropped after 6 months.

In 2013 I started short term/day trading using my fathers account and did it for a year. While reading a Japanese comic I came across warren buffett's name. After reading 'The intelligent investor' I decided to do long term stock investing. I have been investing for 5 years. a year ago I had a portfolio of 59 lakh of which 45 belonged to my dad and 14 was mine. after a fight with my dad i had to stop investing as it was his account. 2months later he agreed to give me my 14 lakh and told me to gtfo.

&#x200B;

6 months back my mom got a bulge in her l4-l5 lumbar spine. my dad refused to pay for her treatment so i had to chip in.

right now my portfolio is at 10.5 lakh.

I can only read and write in english. I can speak in hindi, tamil, telugu, english.

My Covid-19 quarantine experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,158,Non-Political,1942,ffyots,1583805274.0,21dec1989,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 

If you have symptoms, report yourself."

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words. 

Name of boy - Ivaan

Have a blessed day all!

"[NP] I called the police and ambulance on a road accident victim. Ambulance shows up in 4 min, police show up in 20.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a3karl/np_i_called_the_police_and_ambulance_on_a_road/,165,Non-Political,1860,a3karl,1544097657.0,masterveerappan,"As described above. Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.

I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.

The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.

So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.

As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.

In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.

The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.

edit : I have a dashcam. [I just uploaded the file here.](https://gfycat.com/WindingNeedyCod)

edit 2: as u/boredmonk pointed out, I dialed 108 for the ambulance and 100 for police from my friend's mobile phone (on international roaming). No Country code or city code required.

edit 3: I've received beautiful words from you guys. Thank you all."

It has been a few years, and I've traveled to other places since, but lately memories from India have helped me stay strong.

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi, Karnatka, climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world;

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.


Thank you, India. Thank you for all these memories, and a thousand more. I love you and I miss you. Stay the crazy, unique, powerful, beautiful, **wonderful** place that you are.

Request: Please treat your office boys and office maids with dignity and respect,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/80toy3/request_please_treat_your_office_boys_and_office/,281,Non-Political,1830,80toy3,1519825693.0,Madrascalcutta,"Good morning everyone

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.

They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.

I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.

I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.

The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".

To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.

Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.

Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.

If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 

If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.

Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 

TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.

Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone. 

*Edit: Just to add, servants should also be treated with respect and dignity. 

Edit Edit: Thank you for the gold, generous redditor. Definitely appreciate the gesture, but honestly, I don't deserve gold for this rant/ post. "

I issue a first class pass but as there were only 20 people I joined the queue and waited for my turn. A lady came rushing and went straight to the window , at this moment 10-12 mins must have passed and queue was growing as 2 major trains depart and morning rush hour had begun.
I requested her to join the line and got a reply “train is about to come , will miss it” . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her. At last she had to leave and she shouted the words “Idiot bastard” and rushed away shedding her pride. Am I the idiot/bastard in this case ? Why do people get offended when they are being simply told to explain simple rules every citizen has to follow. I know this is very common but I am more offended coz of her retaliation. Also I don’t know why 80% of us don’t speak up against these literate fools who think they have the right to oppress other fellow citizens. I could have abused her right away but didn’t think it was required .

The college was not so supportive and banks were reluctant because for some reason I can't get study loan between the course, and some have not even replied till date.

I had offered to create app/website for randians in exchange of some loan, but instead the community came together helped me raise enough amount that I could pay my final year college fee, something i never expected from my fav sub.

I really want to thank the mods who helped me with the idea of fund raiser, 25 of you who helped me financially and hundreds of individual who offered useful  advice, kept asking me if I needed any more help, some were even willing to offer me internship/projects to work on to cover my expenses. It's due to r/India that I was finally able to [pay my fee](https://i.imgur.com/cmP1DXM.png) with a fine of Rs. 200 though.

Not only the community where I have spent hundreds of hours helped me in most generous way possible, as a result of my post seeking help, I made few friends and got to talk to experienced individuals who gave me useful advice related to my college, career and the world in general.

I am really thankful to this community and the mods for helping me out. The community didn't only help me in this case but also my dozens of other posts asking advice for ""friend"" and my alts :D

Thank you everyone one more time, love you all \<3"

"Hotstar is censoring anything remotely against Disney, even jokes!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dyvv0j/hotstar_is_censoring_anything_remotely_against/,227,Non-Political,1748,dyvv0j,1574248515.0,vijayhere,"So I observed this yesterday while watching John Oliver's Last week tonight on hotstar. He makes jokes on Disney(He jokes on many people, corporations anyway). I observed a cut in scene and suspected a censorship. Immediately went to YouTube and watched that particular segment, which clearly didn't have anything censored. This was a particular recurring scene where he says ""Disney Facts"" over a set of jokes.

Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.

Edit : 
This blew up more than I thought it would. NDTV published an article on this reddit post. Hope hotstar stops censoring. Great going guys!

The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue:

Just like how you were once new to the internet and you were amazed and puzzled by different things, they will also experience the same, but the difference is that they are like the new student who joined the school in the middle of the year. They have to now put twice as effort than you did in the past because everything has evolved so much and there are so many things to know about.

They are new to everything and they will be naive. They will fall into scams and will be exploited. They will be made fun of as they don't know the social etiquette of the internet which you have got used to. They may not even understand English properly or may not understand the underlying technologies which may seem obvious to you.

However, remember that you were also like that once up a time. Perhaps you were privileged to be able to use the internet while it was still a young new thing, but imagine how you would have felt if everyone you met online were a bully to you. Remember that Internet became what it is because there were forums and sites for helping each other on every topic you can think of.

I am saying this because I often see new users being abused by the Internet as the whole.

**Be gentle and welcome the new wave of Internet users.**"

I am cancelling my connections and I hope what I say in this post are compelling enough for you to support me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/,477,Science/Technology,1659,aeblpo,1547098193.0,iheartsubmariner,"I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one."

Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/,353,Politics,1635,e5rae3,1575450746.0,rehnedeyaar,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder."

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases aren’t that many but they’re increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesn’t. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate ‘flu clinic’ and don’t even see the face of the screening centre. I don’t know whether the government can’t afford the testing kits or it doesn’t want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I won’t test them. They’re frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between. I used to be the kind of person who would reach first to the hospital and would be the last to leave but I hate going to work now, I dread talking to people knowing all I am going to do is let them down. Not to mention the hardships I have to face just to reach the hospital from my place of residence because our government has shut down literally every mode of conveyance. So I walk an hour everyday to work only to be cursed by patients and only to put my own health at risk. Please advise your children to not become a doctor. Atleast not in this country."

* I rejoiced each time our cricket team won against theirs. 

* I rejoiced when their diplomatic relationships were shattered. 


As I walked in the mist of ignorance rarely did I see the hypocrisy of my own country, and how could I? It was so pure and true. How can Mother India be anything but holy? 


And as the mist grew thick, I saw the hate crimes against the Muslims of our country. I felt infuriated for I was taught to conjure brotherhood towards all the people of my beloved country.
But how could I? 
*Was I not supposed to discriminate against the Muslims for that is what my ever so righteous parents did?*
All I was but a green child, and so I kept quiet. 



* I kept quiet as they were killed for eating beef. 

* I kept quiet as their fortunes were stripped away by the mobs of unruly. 
* I kept quiet as the government increasingly drifted away from harbouring secularism. 
* I kept quiet as hate crimes became rampant.
* I kept quiet as students were harassed. 



But now the Eastern wind blows wild and the mist falls. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I grow grave with fear that my beloved country is becoming the very thing I was taught to despise. 

*Was I not taught the virtues of secularism? 
Was I not taught the value of equality? 
How can I let my country become the pit of what it stood on?*

The journey takes 46 hours via train. Usually I travel with friends/classmates but I had to stay back a few days so I'm on my own. 

Anyway, I was allotted a lower berth in 2nd ac. Perfect, I thought. I've got a bad back and climbing into the upper berth does it no favours. Things were going well till my berthmates arrived. 

It's a family. A couple and 2 kids. They ask me if I can move to the upper berth to feed their kids and I can come back down after. I'm like ok, cool. I've travelled with kids before so I know how it can be. 

Nope. After dinner, they put the kids to sleep. In my berth. Refusing to give it back. Ok, whatever. I'm not going to see them again after I get down. All good, right? 

Nope. They've decided they want the entire fucking thing to themselves so they've been making life hell to get rid of me. Thankfully, I have a friend in another berth so I've been staying there but whenever I come back to get something or to lie down, they begin shouting, playing music, beating the kids (?!) until I leave. They woke me at 5 in the fucking morning blasting shitty music till I got up and left. 

This is a seat that I've paid a fair bit of money for. How in the fuck can people justify this sort of behavior? Fuck this and fuck them. I'm getting down in 6 hours. 6 long, miserable hours."

I really liked the idea of it. Blind people call you and ask you to be their eyes for some little task. I saw some comments there complaining that they never got the call asking them to help. So I didn't think I'd get any calls. I installed it anyway and selected Marathi, Hindi and English as my languages. 

However, a gentleman called today and I could see a 500 Rs note and he asked me in Hindi what denomination it was! I told him and I almost cried after hanging up the call! It was a surreal experience. Life is so bad for me right now and to be able to help someone, to experience that kind of wholesomeness really perked me up! You all should try it and get blind people you know to use it."

Heres the short version

Thugs in front of me start a fight with me unprovoked because I did not stand up for the national anthem.

I get hit on the face and they incite a crowd against me. They close in and shouting threats to my life.

INOX PULLS ME OUT, and left the thugs there. Thank e manager was flippant towards me and when the police got involved he wrote his case report supporting the mob and against me.

The thugs basically write some hit down and are left free. I was detained for bogus charges for not standing up and 'hurting the dignity of the soverign nation'

Not one person stood up for me when a mob threated my life. I am absolutely disgusted with everyone that was present yesterday.

Im still seething from the injustice and urge you all to boycott inox. That was absolutely unacceptable.

Also for disclosure, I did unload an unholy fuckton of insults and swears on the thugs and subsequent audience that went after me, they were all triggered. But not once did I threaten bodily harm unprovoked. Nor did I shout threats at peoples lives."

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. 

Barun Biswas, a school teacher organized the villagers against these demons. He led the raped women to go to the police and media. The whole village came out to support the teacher in his fight for justice.

After that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.

In 2002, Barun was shot dead by some of the freed members of that gang near Goboardanga railway station while returning from his school. He is a real hero and people of the area still revered him as a legend.

Edit: Barun was shot dead in 2012. Sorry for the mistake."

He seems to be having a really hard time with the adjustment. I want to teach my son some phrases that he can say to the boy so that he knows he has a friend. I don't know what language he speaks but I know he calls his Dad ""Nana""?  Can someone help us with some simple stuff like ""do you want to play"" or ""friend"" or something?  Also any advice would be helpful.

Edit:. Also, I speak only English and Spanish so I need help with pronunciation. :)

Edit:. I'll keep everybody updated. The little boy wasn't at school on Friday because he doesn't come on Fridays I learned. Monday is a holiday here so they won't be in class together until Tuesday at the earliest. My kid picked up on the phrases really quickly and is excited to get to use them!  Thank you so much everybody for your help. I will absolutely let you know how it goes!  Also, thank you for the gold kind stranger!

Update:. Daycare never found out the right language. :(. Although, it doesn't turn out that it really makes a difference. His little friend is picking up English really quickly and not crying anymore at school.  Thank you all so much for your information. It did help my son try and find ways to connect, which means that he made a little friend anyway. Kids really do learn so fast! I'm very glad that my son was sympathetic to his situation.  Thank you good people of r/India!!!"
