So I've been meaning to ask what's your go to earphone under 2k. I was looking to SM e10c and RHA MA390. Currently headphonezone is offering discount on RHA so they are available for 1700.

I've used various earphone but all of them are budget around 1.2k max. I've used boat bassheads 225, Cowon EM1, 1More Piston, CX180, Leaf Sport Wireless, Boat rockers 225 wireless, Mivi thunderbeats. I am very rough user. (I don't like wireless because of sound delay)

Listen to Artist Like Avicii, SHM, Sasha Solan, Julia Michales, Lauv, Annie Marie, Phobe Ryan, Sufijan Steven, B Praak, Anuv Jain, Jasleen Royal, Prateek Kuhad, Goher Mumtaz. I earlier used to listen EDM more so it would be better if you can also keep in mind that.

This is in context to the recent launch of the iPhone SE and the OnePlus 8 models. The iPhone SE is launched at $399 which translates to around Rs.30000. On the other hand the OnePlus pricing started at $699 which translates to around Rs.54000.

However by the time these products actually come to India the iPhone SE is actually somewhere around Rs.42000. On the other hand, OnePlus is able to launch its phones in India at a lower price - Rs 42000 in comparison to the starting Rs. 54000. How is this possible? Are the custom & GST rules different for companies based out of different countries? Or is there a different angle or dynamic to it?",2020-04-21 05:44:16

It's already been 27 days & counting, the people have been abiding the PM and doing their bit. But how long can one be expected to survive solely on food & water.

Opening shops all over doesn't help prevention of the spread of the virus. E-commerce seems to be the only viable option for now. But the CAIT (confederation of All India Traders) wants a level playing field. 

In times like this, is competition more important than getting (& helping) the people stuck in their home what they NEED! 

GOI needs to look at this holistically than satisfying certain lobbies.

As an 80's kid who grew up watching a lot of TV shows, I have a very strong association with TV shows and a point in time and I was wondering if there are others like me. For example, Swat Kats means weekdays, 4 PM. MTV Select is Mon-Thursday 2 PM, Captain Vyom means Sunday 10 AM, The TNT network music jingle means 9 PM and so on and so forth. I was wondering if you all will indulge me and write down the TV show timings that you remember. If you have a specific TV channel or TV events in your head associated with a certain time of the day, that would be awesome too! (For example, AXN means late nights as that was the only time I could watch it without parents noticing, Formula 1 invokes weekend afternoons, Early mornings mean India-Australia test matches, Star TV reminds me of 9-11 PM when my whole family would watch it). I am not interested in the accuracy of the timings (as memories can be imperfect) but I am wondering what specific associations and memories y'all have. I hope some of you find it an interesting exercise and thank you for your time!",2020-04-20 23:53:22

He spent his last days fasting for a clean Ganga in 2018. He died after 112 days.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prof. G. D. Agarwal, alma mater IIT Roorkee UC Berkeley, died from a fast-unto-death to protest against environmentally destructive projects on Ganga and Bhagirathi .

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/12/indian-environmental-activist-fasts-death-over-fate-indias-ganges-river/

He was extremely vocal against illegal river sand mining.

Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 

With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.

I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.

Why do you think mainstream media wants us to focus on Timur ?

Shame on each and every Indian for not knowing about him and his life struggle when he was alive and fighting on our behalf.",2020-04-20 23:00:06

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.

Price of testing kits should be based on income.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4lkpv/price_of_testing_kits_should_be_based_on_income/,18,Coronavirus,4,g4lkpv,1587382994.0,I_can_believe_that,"Nearly, 92% female and 82% male workers in India earn earn less than 10,000 per month, since most of them can’t afford to pay for test kits all government testing labs should be reserved for people of households with income below 10k pm, they should be tested for free. 

People from households with income more than 10,000 per month have to pay some amounts (with some subsidies depending on income) for testing and should be tested at private labs only.

People in the bracket 10,000 pm to 20,000 pm aren’t exactly well-off either they should pay ₹500 per test.

People in the bracket 20,000 -50,000 can pay in 1000s, therefore, they should pay ₹2,500 per test.

People in the bracket 50,000 - 100,000 are pretty well off and should pay ₹4,500 per test.

People earning above ₹1 lakh per month should pay ₹5,000 per test. 

And people earning above ₹2 lakh per month should pay ₹6,500 per test.

The point of well earning people paying more is that they’d be able to fund Indian based manufacturers to boost their production of rapid-testing kits and also the number of private labs. Government bidding test kits from foreign countries should have separate budget, as usual. 

As of now, almost all Indian based companies are planning to keep the cost below ₹2,000

Assuming we’ve got 650,000 test kits from China 3 days ago with some stocks and  two of our local companies HLL and Voxtur that have begun production and expect to produce 100,000 by the end of the week. With more fundings they should be able to meet or even surpass the foreign bought rapid test kits in production units.

why are so many indians and sri lankans so arrogant?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4i22d/why_are_so_many_indians_and_sri_lankans_so/,7,AskIndia,6,g4i22d,1587368611.0,Rimbaud33,"I know they're not the same but i will just say india instead of saying ""India and sri lanka"" every single time because india is more relevant to my subjective experience and because of simplicity, so im not meaning to offend anybody but i've met people from both bakcgrounds and i like and respect their culture but i've noticed something that i usually ignore unitl it's just too annoying

&#x200B;

So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).

Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.

&#x200B;

Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.

&#x200B;

I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?

&#x200B;

Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.

&#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.

&#x200B;

I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online

&#x200B;

it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?

&#x200B;

I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?

&#x200B;

Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?

&#x200B;

do indian people live in denial?

&#x200B;

or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?

&#x200B;

the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay

&#x200B;

I just don't get it

&#x200B;

what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?

I'd like to know what you guys think :)

&#x200B;

edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong. 

Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics, not always, of course, i'm not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality, but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience.

I hope i didn't offend anyone because i am genuinely interested in this, i like indian food, folklore, art and philosophy i am personally inclined to buddhism :) ",2020-04-20 13:13:31

The government didn't take any measure to implement widespread testing, hence we really don't have enough data to identify the clusters or hotspots.  It's like a ticking time bomb; once the lockdown is over, in a matter of weeks we could expect the infection cases to climb up again exponentially. 

Not to mention, they just left the poorest of the poor to die helplessly on the roads. Are we just going to ignore the piles of bodies? 

I don't see anyone talking about any plans for the future. This isn't going to go away until a solid vaccine is discovered. What are we going to do going forward?",2020-04-20 09:22:10

HCQ to be tested on thousands in Mumbai’s Dharavi and Worli to prevent Covid-19 spread,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4dtqh/hcq_to_be_tested_on_thousands_in_mumbais_dharavi/,7,Science/Technology,13,g4dtqh,1587353611.0,whine_glass,"BMC is going to start testing effectiveness of HCQ among residents of Worli and Dharavi ([Article](https://theprint.in/health/hcq-to-be-tested-on-thousands-in-mumbais-dharavi-and-worli-to-prevent-covid-19-spread/404133/)). From what I know, the drug has side-effects and it's efficacy has been contested in several clinical trials. The article mentions that the initial plan of testing 50,000 people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study.


As a layman, I had the following questions:


- What are the possible side-effects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions?



- Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions (quality of water, sanitation etc.), is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely? What implications does it have for the results of the experiment, even if it's carried out as planned? (Link to study for this claim [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141369/))



- Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past? From what I know, such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale.



- Thoughts about notion of informed consent for this study under these conditions?

I don't think I will be able to find any job after the lockdown end. I don't know if it is worthwhile to pursue ACCA has anyone done that? 

I am losing sleep thinking about this and I don't know what to do with my life. Any advice would be appreciated.",2020-04-20 06:07:20

"[NSFW maybe] What was always ubiquitous in schools, but people don't like to talk about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4919v/nsfw_maybe_what_was_always_ubiquitous_in_schools/,15,AskIndia,38,g4919v,1587337169.0,ainy_jaffri,"I wanted to say some memories from early school. Nothing shocking, just normal things, thoughts ... 

What do you make of your frame-of-mind when you used to go to school (as in before class 9)? Sometimes, talking to people in my college or other places, I feel that they've forgotten our point of view from even the recent past. And everyone just accepts that kids are naive in one way. Everything's normal if we just accept that we're worse today than how we used to be when we were that little.

So is it right? Whatever age you are now, you probably remember having choice when you were half your age, don't you? If you're a bigger sibling or a parent reading this, do you wory that you can't do enough for the kids?

You may have gone to a good school, or not at all -- who knows really what is worse; but school like I remember was never a place where I went to study good things like math and science and geography. Everyday we play-acted the Lord of the Flies.

These thoughts/memories are not in any order. I'm just writing them as I remember off the top of my head ...

In your experience, when did you first notice developing hierarchies in schools (and not caused by the administration directly)? My earliest memory is from when I was in class 4 or 5. There was in my class one student who was a repeater, so he was older and taller than the rest us. All the other boys looked up to him. My parents never gave me a phone or a computer even until much later, and I was not bright either, so I was impressed by anyone that seemed to have a clue. In this class and being in the cool-only group, we played cricket and football in break time and other time we sniffed dendrite and whitener and the obvious things you can guess, while the adults had no clue or didn't care what went on in the last benches. I learned also that I could make the best grades in class easily when I focused my mind, which wasn't easy.

Did the faculty keep the rooms clean? Many times in empty classrooms there was left in one corner or inside a desk, empty pepsi/fanta-type bottles into which someone had ejaculated. This kind of usual stuff, like also the fan blades being bent etc., happened from mid-school to maybe class 8. There's some version of this everywhere. This one I've only heard from others: Some guy peed in (or spat in) someone's waterbottle and put it back in the victim's school bag.

Do you agree with the notion that some cousin of racism has always been present in our schools, even from the first day? I don't remember that far back, but as far as I can, I call it by that name. Like if we can think of the worst racist bigot in politics, and multiply that by 10, there's the equivalent of the classmates I had growing up. haha! It's funny saying it that way. It's cute now that we get outraged when some public personality lets out a distasteful opinion. I hate it too, but I wish we stopped acting surprised. From what I remember, growing up in our schools: people's skin colour, weight, speech impediment, financial status, any disability was always fair game. And the teacher's were not innocent. They used racial slur's all the time, and strangely, there were some teachers who were plain cruel. People who come straight out of a horror movie. Umm ... it just seemed odd that for no reason at all, a teacher would twist someone's surname into something nasty-sounding, or pull a sardar joke out of his ass while waiting for the bell to ring. 

We would haze very badly, anyone who is gay. I was so dumb that I thought for sure that gay means something bad (because of a Aamir Khan movie I saw). In school there was only one person who explicitly identified in this way. I never got a chance to say sorry. Even when that person would cry we would come again the next day and call him names and attach his name with some other guy and bully. Beats me that we got away with this.

In class 6 or 7, I think, sometimes our subject teacher was absent. Other teachers started to pop-in from time-to-time to check and punish anyone that was out seat. Students invented were weird ways to pass the boredom, like one that went like this. Because we couldn't go anywhere, the ""dare"" part of the truth-or-dare game was removed and the truth-teller had to now compulsorily pick from one of the options. The only point was to humiliate a new guy by making him say stupid shit. Always it's the same question: whose dick would you suck? The older players pressured the new guy until he said some other guy's name. Then the older players say something like ""but why not this other one? what's wrong with this color?"" Then the new seemingly straight guy tries to clarify and digs his own grave, while the rest egg him on. Kinda weird we came up with this prank. Freud would've something to say about this.

One girl from where I worked told me this. In elementary grade, her best friend (girl) had facial hair slightly excess. Her conservative parents ""sent her to school to study and not focus on fashion."" One day her classmates teamed up and secretly drew a face with large moustache with chalk and wrote her name on blackboard. Everyone saw this and laughed at her and she cried. This happened in front of the teacher and the full class (they had some loadshedding situation that allowed opportunity for this particular prank). After this incident she never went back to that school. Don't worry, she's still alive. She felt very hurt and convinced her parents, then they pulled strings to tranfer her to different school. Maybe she was holding her depression for long time and what was funny for others was unbearably hurtful. (unrelated, but have you seen that funny video of the penis cat permanent marker prank on the teacher?)

This is my memory from class 5 or 6. I still feel angry if I think of it. I don't care now I guess. I had got the feeling that a gym teacher was following me around in school. He was a grey haired stoutish guy who also taught karate or something to students. It was not a overt ""tag you're it"" kind of following. That's why I never told anyone because it's very strange and I think no one will believe me. I just saw this asshole appear out of nowhere like right beside me talking to another teacher or near the door or any entrance and talking to another teacher right at the moment I was walking past it. Every morning after chapel when we lined up to go back to class, he seemed to somehow end up in line ahead or behind from me either immediately or there was one or two students between us. I didn't know who to complain to or what I will say in the complain. He was well-respected in school as he was involved whenever charity event or activity happened. He didn't make eye contact or anything but you have no idea what that felt like when suddenly I saw him crossing my classroom on any days for no reason. This creepy behaviour was making me depressed day by day. After class 6, the classes were in different building in different location in the city. I was relieved to never have to see this creep again. Now that I'm in college, even though I'm living in different city, I wish I meet him randomly on the street sometime because I'll kick the living shit out of him.

My classmates and I, had heard of planchettes and that stuff for the first time in class 7. We are very dense, especially I. Anyway, there was this fainting technique/trend whatever-it's-called that we had heard recently. A person had to perform a few moves (I don't think it's necessary that I list our version here) and this would cause them to pass-out (probably due to lack of oxygen in the brain or something). One of my friends volunteered or maybe we evilly coaxed him into it. That evening, the seven of us went to a friend's home, to test if the fainting thing actually works. In the friend's room, it was now night. We stood surrounding him just far enough that he wouldn't fall and break his neck and die (but really we were not paying attention because we doubted it would even work). On the third attempt he suddenly started walking and jumped from the top of a staircase straight to the bottom. The rest of us almost shit our pants, and for a few seconds we froze instead of running to help our friend. Only I went to check the corpse, but when I reached the landing, our friend had begun to get up on his own. He had this cool new gash above his eye and blood dripping, and just stared at me wondering why we were staring back at him! like we'd seen a ghost! He had no memory of jumping or fainting or the pain of the forehead splitting. We went together the six of us to hospital (one of the guys called a taxi and went home, I thought he literally shat himself), and got his forehead stitched up.

> 
> During January 26–February 10, 2020, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters. The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation.

r/COVID19 post: https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g3sgcf/covid19_outbreak_associated_with_air_conditioning/

Personally I think we need to give importance to the fact that there are summer viruses and winter viruses and they need different combinations of temperature+humidity.

Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/transmission/

> Humidity (best if between 50% and 80%)
> 
> ""It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane"" [source] Relative humidity (RH, or Saturation Ratio: the state of vapor equilibrium in room air) affects all infectious droplets with respiratory viruses, independent of their source (respiratory tract or aerosolized from any fluid) and location (in air or settled on surfaces). Relative humidity therefore affects all transmission ways but has the most pronounced effect on airborne transmission. [source]
> 
> ""Measurements of indoor humidities in 40 residential apartments in New York (19) and in 6 high-quality commercial buildings in the Midwest (20) showed indoor vapor pressure of below 10 mb or indoor RH of below 24% in the winter"" [source]
> 
> Experiments conducted in a study indicated ""a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH (20–50%), while the stability of summer or all-year viruses enhanced at higher RH (80%)"" [source]

Therefore, while our population size, education/awareness and density are strong disadvantages to us, **maybe** there is some advantage to be had if we **stop using air-conditioning entirely for the duration of the pandemic wherever possible**. 

This is speculation, but I believe **it merits proper investigation**.

Alternative credit score & Automating the Entire process to reduce the Turn around time of loans into seconds

I want to solve this problems 

- In India, Just 35 millions pay Income tax out of 130 millions. Here credit underwriting model uses credit bureau data, Bank statements, Income tax returns.  So, 97% people are not accessed to formal credit. Still they borrow from the loan mafia & they charge exorbitant interest rates. There is need for alternative credit assessment, by using smartphone data & using social security numbers. 

- The Turn around time for the loans is 7 days to 3 Months. While the world battles issues centering around data privacy and consent, the Account Aggregator & Indian stack will allow both individuals and businesses to share their financial data in digital form with third parties in a safe manner. 

- Credit Risk - Risky Business 
 
Predicting the risk of customer credit default. How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. 

Unlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer. By applying advances in machine learning we can able to radically outperform traditional scorecards in both consumer and small business lending. 

By building models on more than simple default, and focusing on such outcomes as profitability and customer lifetime value, we allow you to fully leverage artificial intelligence to increase your lending performance. 

- Ample computing power and digital data are the fuel for machine learning, of course. The more data and the more iterations the algorithmic engine goes through, the better its output gets. Data scientists come up with probabilistic prediction models for specific actions, and then the algorithm churns through loads of data to produce better decisions in real time with every iteration. These prediction models become the basis for most business decisions.

- we applied for Account aggregator license from Reserve bank of India, we get all public data like Banking, Mutual funds, insurance etc. we are in the process building the consortium to share non financial data.

- By Automating the entire process &  building the algorithms using supervised learning, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, Experimenting & building software stack. I hope we can solve this problem. 

- current credit bureau has many flaws like their algorithm is  blatantly opaque, they don’t use real time data, their business model itself skeptical. 

- So, we want to start a platform which can adds value to the both lenders & borrowers.

- We are looking for AI, ML engineers, data scientists who can build probabilistic models, blockchain enthusiasts,Front end designers for building the application & app.

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 


###Dilip Ghosh, BJP

Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   

###Mamata Banerjee, TMC

I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",2020-04-19 22:52:34

What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g43omc/what_ht_wouldnt_publish_the_folly_and_vanity_of/,3,Policy/Economy,17,g43omc,1587310658.0,bob_semple_,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)

Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  

*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 

In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhi’s Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: “Why is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capital’s catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?”

In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores “on a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhi’s pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the people’s good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.”

The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishore’s article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firm’s previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their execution  “upon the removal of  “obstacles” like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practices”. The firm’s past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting “an innate disrespect for the  citizen”.

In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:

“The biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs Elysées? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: ‘It brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayer’s expense.”

Kishore’s essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.

In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.

Also read: [In Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Central Vista Project Should Be Reviewed](https://thewire.in/urban/covid-19-central-vista-project-new-delhi)

The prime minister’s own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone – the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldn’t quite do  for Narendra Modi.

To my mind, the Modi government’s redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  ruler’s immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean Bédel-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaul’s essay ‘[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)’).

Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  

As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why can’t the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme – estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting – be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?

Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money – not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year – probably longer – before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.

In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice – sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.

Scamming people to sign up to their platform using the name of SURAKSHA STORE ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3z60v/scamming_people_to_sign_up_to_their_platform/,1,Coronavirus,9,g3z60v,1587288664.0,regover,"Hi guys,

So my father has an essential store and he gets this message on whatsapp saying that govt has launched a website to register your company as Suraksha Store so that they can get govt benefits.

Website: [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (very believable domain for the average non tech guy)

Here is what made me suspicious:

1. The website didn't open for me as I had high-security settings for chrome (ERR: Too many redirects)
2. No mention of website in any news
3. Powered by SafeJob at the end which is a private company
4. Copyright to suraksha circle (i.e. the circle that GOI has asked us to make where people will stand)
5. After filling the form, it asked us to get a certificate so that we can get approved faster and that certification needs us to login to their website [safejob.in](https://safejob.in) where we need to create account and do a suraksha certificate course
6. The course is a video where they explain how to make your store a suraksha store and then asks a basic quiz (which is a good deed they're doing acc. to me)

Here are my findings:

1. Terminal command I used:-  whois  [surakshastore.com](https://surakshastore.com) (Only for tech guys)
2. The domain is being bought by Vineet Tiwari of Safeducate
3. There was no information that I could find linked to GOI
4. I checked socials of both safejob and safeducate (none of them have posted about it)
5. On website of safeducate, it says Ministry of rural development  but on surakshastore, it's ministry of home affairs (This might be against my hypothesis)

Link of whois result: [https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com](https://in.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=surakshastore.com&recaptchaResponse=03AHaCkAYKFQoubZUr1si98nAJnDn0VM5x5Z43VMMjUoyLO1OfY6lZsxqf1KTMRFuBsIi-l1TfdDBlHZ8lnGsQITNwXSt0vzgA9qzvXb0vT-855S7tRKA89dveP9obUN1_-4h7_BMwDaHKbO10AhbG4UDY6cgIKuESpGtZuoB0ButrjvBGiUqvDeaZ0rheIJiXAfst1Ur0jfVO2kLAyWXtK06gIqJ91T5GNjTbLLFxLxiJDlMY_Xw_Z13ms4xI2exVKuKWLsEF6CxdGASDWCqJFs6ZRmhX3i32QIYVxC0Q5n-p1qHW8r1-Q0KfTP3SML-_LYUisjC8ov5kzPWswqFk2fP3l_p5gNwCPxZ57_NWY6SPL4NO1zck4RvLec_PsHxBc3siRu0R1RArgdRwKA3YzlcyD_kvPxKpcQ)

(Link cut off in the text as was too long , don't copy-paste text please)

Although I highly think this is a scam, I would want to ask you guys if you think otherwise and if you also find that this website is a scam, please notify your Whatsapp groups. (Lies circulate through WhatsApp, so let the truth tackle it there itself)

I'm open to any sources that prove that this is not a scam. If it is a scam, then you have to be the lowest of scums to make profit in these times scamming people.

&#x200B;

PS A request please, let's not blame any political party/group until we have concrete evidence (no, photo with any party isn't concrete, investments of a party in the company is)  that they're involved as I don't want this to become a political thread.",2020-04-19 15:01:04

Need help! Someone threatened to kill me.

It was a heated conversation. I did not provoke the other person. The other person threatened to kill me, and harm me, and hurt me violently. The person said this several times. I have the call recorded.   

The situation is:   

the conversation was pertaining to something in location X.  
I reside in location Y, different state, some 300-400 km from location X.  
And the other person is currently in location Z, some 500+ km from both City X and City Y, and in a different state.  
The person clearly mentioned they would kill me in location X. also made a slight remark they would harm me in location Y.  

If I want to file a police complaint against the person for threatening to kill me,   

1. In which city police station should I file the complaint?
* Whether this is solid grounds to file this complaint? (threatening to kill me/harm me , over phone call.)
* Whether recording of phone call is admissible proof?
* Whether my phone would be kept in police custody?

I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.

I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.

Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!

I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!

I also tried and opened a case with resolver, wrote to their social media channels including Twitter, nowhere could I get any help.

But what I find more outrageous is their people have the guts to manipulate wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikhil_Kumar_(actor)  ) and phrase it as ""The wedding took place on April 17, 2020[9] near Janapada Loka in Ramanagara[10], but caused controversy as it was held during the extended Janata Curfew""

As far as I know, the janata curfew was voluntary and long back. On April 17, the lockdown and social-distancing was in full effect. But these folks are phrasing it on wiki so damn casually. As if the lockdown translates to janata curfew for VIPs.

Is no legal action being taken against these people for violating the lockdown so blatantly?
If there are any wiki editors here, hopefully they have the good sense to fix the phrasing in the page I linked to.",2020-04-19 17:27:17

I am designing a software to help physios save some time, while impacting their income positively. I need some data for that. Please help me with some questions. The following questions are not specific to your practice, but generally about physiotherapy in India.
 
Generally, how many sessions does a person need for his rehab?

What % of patients leave their therapy incomplete?

What would be the reasons for a patient to leave their therapy incomplete?

Generally how much more do home visits cost as compared to patient visiting the clinic?

Do physiotherapy patients have a waiting time at clinic? If yes, what would be the approximate time that patients need to wait for?

What other challenges do patients face in regards to their physiotherapy?

What are the challenges that physios face in their day to day business operations?

How often do physios have to work with multiple patients at one time?

How often do physios have to stretch their schedules/work hours because of excess patients?

How often do physios themselves face occupational hazards like back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain due to manual work or physically demanding sessions?

How many maximum sessions can an average physiotherapist do in a month? I am trying to understand the income ceiling of an average physio.

What are the fixed expenses per month of an average physio?

What are the ways that an average physio uses to cross the monthly income ceiling?",2020-04-19 17:25:28

India is a stark contrast compared the USA from what I've seen, but that has only made me want to travel there even more. I had some burning questions I would love some answers to. Besides some YouTubers and books, it can be hard to get some valuable information about traveling to India, as most Americans are baffled at the thought of me VOLUNTARILY wanting to go to India, and only think of it as a dirty and extremely poor 3rd world country without even researching the country.

1. Would you recommend doing a guided tour (even though they can be cheesy and touristic at times) for my first time in India or would it be doable to solo travel or travel with a few friends? I've heard India can be very overwhelming for foreigners at first, but I wanted to know your thoughts.
2. What are some safety tips that are actually TRUE and not stereotypical. I've heard about the poor water quality, Delhi belly (caution against street food), beggars, so HOT, not to walk outside at night, scammers on the street, dirty, filled with pollution, etc. but I want to know if there is any truth to any of this and what I can do to have a great experience.
3. What cities (and sights) would you most recommend for a first-timer in India if I were to travel there for 7-10 days? Where can I find the busiest and most chaotic streets in India (as this fascinates me, as in the USA the roads are very organized). What kind of budget would I need for 7-10 days?
4. Also just out of curiosity, what stereotypes of India or Indian people would you wish to disappear as they are not true?
5. What else can I do to best prepare for a trip to India?

Any information, suggestions, tips, or advice would be greatly appreciated!",2020-04-19 11:53:54

Just INR 1500 will fund an emergency 21-day food/ration pack which will be provided to each of these families. This is being done by Rotary Bangalore Indiranagar.

Please support this campaign by clicking on the link above and donate with a Credit/Debit card, Paytm, UPI, Net-banking, etc. Foreign funding is allowed too. This campaign has 80G tax benefits.

A dilemma,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3ry8v/a_dilemma/,2,AskIndia,1,g3ry8v,1587261862.0,aclulmpg," I know There are similar posts right now on this topic but i am posting this here because i have  asked this  question on Quora and I haven't gotten any answer.I hope I can get an answer on this site.       
 
  So this is about my brother who is an assistant manager in a PSU (public sector undertaking).Its a good secure job but there is a strong  chance  that this company might be privatised within 10 years.After passing out from his college my brother  was placed in an IT Company but he didn't  take that  up  because he wanted a secure govt. job.His CGPA is 8.2 and gre score  is 334 so he is very sure he will  get admission to a tier 1 university.   

His first problem is that he is a EC (electronics and communication)graduate and doesn't have much knowledge of computer science and doesn't have any significant coding experience.The only  language he knows is C++.  So he is concerned whether he will be able to cope up acdemically.
 The second (possible) obstacle is his age.He is almost 30 years old now and by the time he will have completed his MS he will be 32.Will this be a problem in getting a job in the US?( he doesn't want a job in India)
  
Our third concern is the current scenario in US with the coronavirus and possible  changes to the H1b visa process.Will this affect his chances  ?  
.Is it worth risking a secure  job for this opportunity?is it feasible?",2020-04-19 07:34:22

My sincere thought was and is still that - whatever desk jobs can be done through Work from home(WFH) should be done in that way without any loosening of screws - which the govt seems to be doing now. 

Especially for IT sector employees who are working from home and thereby not putting undue stress on a societal level even inadvertently - on their fellow colleagues, office staff, their own health, their near ones health and the greater population - especially for  them who are actually equipped to do WFH , why the rush to loosen up everything now as if after 20th April, Covid19 would magically disappear.

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

"TIL that in UP and Bihar, almost six out of ten deaths were not registered in the death statistics (based on the latest available CRS data from 2017)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3n6wq/til_that_in_up_and_bihar_almost_six_out_of_ten/,0,Coronavirus,9,g3n6wq,1587243885.0,jai_ho_kick,"  
TL;DR, India lacks systematic registration of deaths even in the absence of the current pandemic. It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.

  
There have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India's success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.

Today, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).

I was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):

1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).
2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.

Moreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The ""cause of death"" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))

Given these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. 

These are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths.",2020-04-19 02:34:45

India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/,123,Non-Political,219,g3mehq,1587240047.0,kullky_2020,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",2020-04-19 01:30:47

Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3lncu/horlics_chocolate_powder_vs_cadbury_cocoa_powder/,23,Food,18,g3lncu,1587235850.0,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

So I heard about Asur from Reddit where op praises the show, so checked IMDb, it had a rating of 8.7 so I decided to give it a shot.
Watched it within 2 days and was completely disappointed .
The show is full of plot holes some of these are,
* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.
*Oxygen chamber having timer instead of an oximeter. Also the clock speed up when hostages are idle but works Normal when they're trying to kill eachother where oxygen consumption is increased.

You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.

The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.

The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

Only thing which is good is the soundtrack.
A complete disappointment.

My rating 6.5/10.",2020-04-18 22:28:49

I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.

Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*",2020-04-18 21:17:29

Mom being inherently biased against muslims. Help me change her views.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3fogm/mom_being_inherently_biased_against_muslims_help/,26,AskIndia,0,g3fogm,1587204950.0,NewThrowaway543210,"To give it a bit of context (She stays with dad in a tier 3 city with no contact to anyone apart from work friends, I live in a tier 1 city because of job)

I recently had an argument with my Mom, about the role of muslims in the recent covid 19 spread in India. I said I'm not disagreeing that certain groups of the muslim community are solely responsible for a massive spike in infections, but the tone that you are implying means that you had a problem with muslims long before this covid infection started.

Upon hearing this, she went full defensive mode, saying muslims are responsible for all the wars with India and they are responsible for every atrocity in India. I asked how many muslims have you spoken to in your life ?  She said she knows about Pakistan and the wars and that is enough. She said they are ""abishwas jati""

Our argument heated up and now I'm here asking what do I do to change her opinion that all muslims aren't ""Pakistani"" and aren't out to destroy the world. Media doesn't portray muslim in good light and it has led to years of indoctrination with older people who have no other contact other than media. But I am not saying I am apologising for muslims. I am an atheist and consider all religions to be irrelevant, islam to be the most if I had to draw a priority chart.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  One more point, To make matters worse, when Italy was #1 in covid infections, I found she was googling, ""how many muslims are there in Italy"". It was both hilarious and sad that she drew causality vs correlation, though that argument would have failed as well as Italy is not a muslim majority country.",2020-04-18 15:45:50

### Tl; dr

IFF’s Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper’s analysis of the partnership through the lens of what’s good, possible risks and the project’s relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.

### Background | The Promise of Scale and Privacy

Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world’s two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.

### Proposed Timelines

Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.

### The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy

To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required.  Similar to Singapore’s *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFF’s Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user’s device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people’s privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu app’s own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their “close proximity” interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual’s phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person’s phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.

### Risks Arising from the Project

One of the large outcomes of the coronavirus’ impact in relation to people’s increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people’s movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people’s fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people’s personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations.  Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project’s first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions.  Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.

It is important to highlight that India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF’s submission will address the whitepaper/consultation’s interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

But they have resumed it through online method.  

Now here's the problem. This place has a hell lot of mosquitoes. Tonight i had high grade fever with chills and rigor. No coughing, sneezing or breathing issues of any kind.I m highly suspicious that it is malaria. If i tell my aunt, she will panic, and will ask me to leave. If i stay here, I won't be cured, bz, no matter what i try, I can't get rid of mosquitoes (this house doesn't has a mosquito net). And if i go to a hospital and get admitted, my aunt won't accept me back once i m discharged. I don't know what to do.
Although i can get myself tested for malaria and start the treatment, if it's positive, on my own, hiding the fact from my aunt's family and hoping for recovery in this mosquito infested locality.

Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",2020-04-18 05:49:56

Every time someone mentions that the number of Covid cases are low in India, you are likely to meet the ""We aren't doing enough testing"" quote.   
When you consider the data point of ""tests per million"", you will see India faring quite bad but again most of the other countries aren't dealing with a huge population crisis or even the vastness of a country like ours.   
So don't you think no matter how many tests we conduct we are anyways going to fare lowly in that metric point ? So my question is why are we complaining about the low number of tests per million and is it actually a valid data point for us to ponder over ?   
Data Source : [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries)   
If you notice China which is our closest in terms of population has played with their numbers to an extent where no one knows whats real or whats not. So what metric can I look at and say ""Hey the govt is not doing that bad a job"" or ""Hey, it's a shit show out there""!

So what is the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test has three simple, unambiguous criterias:

* A film has to have at least two (named) women characters in it.

* These women characters at some point of the movie talk to each other.

* They talk about something other than men.

The test has it's inspiration (seemingly) in an 1929 essay by Virginia Woolf.

One of the larger samples tested in 2019 resulted in very few Hindi movies actually passing the same.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6Amqk0gSE

I'm not even sure how regional cinema fares in this.

Television all across the country seems like it will fail the same miserably.

While the test has no assurance about the *quality* of female representation in the said movie \ work of fiction - one small incentive is, **it's observed that movies who do meet the criteria are known to perform better financially, than those who don't.**

Why is the Modified Media continuously playing the same propaganda themes again and again? It is by design not by chance. Here are some thoughts on this,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g318gs/why_is_the_modified_media_continuously_playing/,7,Politics,59,g318gs,1587156035.0,jatadharius,"First of all  It's a feature not a bug. And is being consistently working towards its goal.

The way media is behaving in last few years, it seems we are inching more and more towards a totalitarian form of government. The idea that media can be effectively used to control and sway public sentiments is not new. One of the earliest major successes stories when the media was used in this manner comes from Nazi Germany. I will quote some relevant paragraphs from [Mein Kampf](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54153/page/n3/mode/2up) (particularly Chapter 6 War Propaganda) which seems to be like the cookbook for our present incumbents.

Second it is not dumb. In case you are wondering that the ""intellectual level"" of the media has dropped, it is talking to the masses who are not ""intellectual"". It is by design that the content has been ""dumbed down""

> To whom should  propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or to the less educated masses? 

> It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses. 

> What the intelligentsia — or those who today unfortunately 
often go by that name — what they need is not propaganda but scientific instruction. The content of propaganda is not science  any more than the object represented in a poster is art.

> All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. 

> It is not the purpose of propaganda to provide a series of thrills with a view to pleasing these blase gentry. Its chief function is to convince the masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be given time in order that they may absorb information; and only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd. 


About the persistence of the themes, the Hindu-Muslim divide, the ""other"",

> Any variation must not alter the main theme of the propaganda, but must always emphasize the same point. The slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end the stress must always be laid on the slogan itself. In this way alone can propaganda be consistent and dynamic in its effects. 

> Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly, with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then we shall be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results that such a persistent policy secures. The success of any advertisement, whether of a business or a political nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance with which it is employed.

And they are not the only ones that have this kind of attitude to the larger population that is Hindu. There are many such Islamic congregations that operate under the same sense of autonomy from the state.

But instead of focusing on those bearded lungi-wallas we should look at the funders of such programs in India. And this is not the only country that is being funded to make its muslims more conservative and Wahabbi. Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, everyone of these countries is prey to this.

Where is all this funding coming from? Follow the money, dammit! Oldest rule in the book when you're investigating a crime.

When will Arknb and the rest -- including the so called Left Media, Wire, Print, NDTV, Hindu -- speak out against Saudi funding for Wahabbi hardline Muslim dogma in our country that has already rotted a big chunk of its population?

That’s not to say that the right is unlimited or something, there sure must be reasonable restrictions wherever applicable, the question must be how much the limits must be, that is, where should we draw the border, if at all, it’s necessary..

And also when someone voices their opinion in a large gathering, for example, especially this subreddit, it’s not practical to know what opinion offends which person. It’s simply not viable. Furthermore, censoring something one says just because it hurts someone else’s beliefs or feelings can be counterintuitive, as they’ll just be more vocal in raising their opinion.

However I suppose not everyone thinks of it in that way, and therefore I seek consensus regarding this matter, hope it helps all of us in the long run..!!",2020-04-17 21:52:43

This happened 2 days ago, without any permission from police, and now if anyone needed to go out to buy essentials, they would be forced to use a gulli (small road) just beside the barricade. 

Note: One of those people had stated two weeks ago on the colony WhatsApp group that he had seen a vegetable vendor licking the vegetables, and when he screamed and tried to catch him, he ran away. (I and many of my friends don't believe him, as he is a far right wnger who wants the complete destruction of muslims, judging from some of his past WhatsApp forwards. Also, there's no way a vendor with a heavy vegetable carrying thela can outrun the man who ""saw him licking"")

The problem with the barricades? The people living around that gully road began having problems with everyone going from that side. Infuriated, they put up a barricade as well. 

One of my friends who lives just beside the barricades, just called me and told that a couple of police vehicles arrived and those people were called. They were scolded heavily and were warned to not do anything like this again. The barricades were then removed. 

I was extremely angry at the fact that they didn't even think of other people who live there, while putting up barricades without permission. It was an unnecessary move that didn't serve any purpose.

The case for Covid-19 cases in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2ygx8/the_case_for_covid19_cases_in_india/,0,Coronavirus,14,g2ygx8,1587143403.0,Vishuliaris,"Alright, since there’s a lot going on, let’s start with the basics:
A Quick recall: A new virus strain emerges out of the Wuhan Province of China last December, China declares it on Jan 1, then WHO declares it a ‘Public health Emergency’ on 30th January, then a pandemic on 11th March (A Pandemic is rapid spread of a disease amidst a large populace, within a short interval of time, spanning multiple continents).
Mass hysteria follows, as it usually does these days. Experts suggest social distancing as the best way to ensure lower spread of disease, forcing the government to finally act and ensure shutdown measures, so that our especially overwhelmed healthcare system doesn’t get even more so.
The name of this Novel (new) Coronavirus is now SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) since it being a cousin(not sibling, for that’s reserved for its mutations) of the SARS Coronavirus, a virus responsible for the 2003 SARS pandemic which spread primarily in the South Eastern Countries, and caused 770 deaths and 8000 infected people worldwide;

Here’s the case, since this is a new virus in town, we cannot possibly diagnose an infected person without testing him/her, this is NOT a seasonal fever/flu virus, this is 10 times deadlier, and has an incubation period (time it can stay alive inside human body) of 14 days, unlike the 3 days of seasonal flu.
Also, a person who is a carrier(who has the virus inside, but doesn’t fall sick) will be better able to spread the virus, compared to a sick person who gets noticed and screened out!
Best example of this being the 19 year old (way out of high-risk age groups of 60 years & above) Pizza Delivery guy, with no foreign travel history, in Delhi who tested positive, resulting in 70 families being quarantined.
Point I am trying to make here is that, that you can’t confirm Covid-19 cases, until you have enough Covid-19 tests done.
India’s share of Covid-19 tests is 0.2 for every 1000 people!
The Math: Total population of our country being 1,350,689,521, divided by 2,86,714 number of tests (according to last night’s data) would be 4710.92, which per thousand, is 0.21.
Meaning India has only conducted 0.2 tests per 1000 people, one of the lowest in the world, and the lowest in per capita.
Concurrently, the places with highest number of cases also are the ones who conducted the most number of tests, which isn’t mere coincidence.
The Propaganda: As of writing this, India has 13,425 positive cases with 446 deaths, and 1756 recovered, which is being hailed as monumental achievement, compared to other developed countries who have much more sophisticated healthcare systems than we can even imagine. This narrative being pushed by the Authorities is even bigger reason to worry than the pandemic since it is based on either them duping themselves, or the people, either way, we all lose.

The dunning Kruger: Dr RR Gangakhedkar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said in a statement that, India is conducting 24 test for every one positive case diagnosed, which is much higher than Japan’s 11.7, Italy’s 6.7, & US’ 5.3. Quite frankly this metric escapes my understanding, because:

If we can conduct tests for 24 individuals for every single positive case, and if the growth trends in the cases follow, then we’ll be able to test each and every one of 1.3 billion citizens in a couple of weeks. Not sure there are currently enough test kits in the world, let alone in India, for pulling off such a feat.

Say out of a sample of 500 of such 24 individuals’ tests, we get one positive case(optimistically speaking), then currently we have 1,12,557 infected people who haven’t been diagnosed yet, a number which will significantly spike, by the time they are identified, let alone tested.",2020-04-17 22:40:03

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

Untill he chooses a profession for himself, why not show him what careers and this world is like  in some kind of Vanity van or exploring bus?

Parental Supervision - Once the kid returns back to home from the school he faces his parents. A lot of parents are not trained to deal with kids. Still these parents advice them, scold, influence and in worst cases, abuse and beat the children. What is the need for a parental supervision after a minimum age like 10?

Colleges - A college for medical science or civil/ mechanical engineering might be necessary. But for computer engineering, what's the need for making a person attend lectures on topic he has already learnt well from Udemy and make him waste 3 years for a course in college that he can cover in just 1.5 years by himself?

Jobs - I have felt a lot of people are frustrated with their jobs. The frustrations can be can be reduced if we give them atleast a 10 day vacation to a peaceful place after every 90 days. Makes it 40 days in a year. Government Jobs have 30. Private jobs give lesser than that. In India, this is even more important as traffic and noise is too much in the cities and people crave for a heaven escape after every few weeks or months. 

Arranged Marriage - Its often difficult for those in a love marriage to keep the love intact for upto 50 years. Imagine how scary it would be for those in an arranged marriage to live together for even 10 years.

Stigma against Hookup Culture - Nations like India are famous for tinder bios like ""Not here for hookups"". Even a lot of parents of girls are against sex before marriage, compelling these girls to meet their boyfriends in secrecy. I don't know why parents do this but I have heard it is done to increase the value and sanctity of their daughter for the groom who comes as the highest bidder with the highest paying job.

First #RSS runs checkpoints in Hyderabad to enforce #Modi’s #lockdown. Now police in Agra line up obediently to be “honored” by RSS. Notice police are observing #socialdistancing but uniformed members of Nazi-inspired paramilitary are not. 

RSS is in control of lockdown.

Bollywood Nazis: A Tale of Two Sisters,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2pd5o/bollywood_nazis_a_tale_of_two_sisters/,9,Politics,29,g2pd5o,1587105343.0,iSalaamU,"Yesterday, Twitter permanently suspended the account of Rangoli Chandel, Kangana Ranaut's sister and manager, for a tweet that was too hateful even for Twitter, the single largest enabler of hate speech after Facebook and Whatsapp.

Following is the text of the tweet, verbatim:

""A Jamati died of Corona when police and doctors went to check their families they were attacked and killed, make these mullas + secular media stand in a line and shoot them dead... F**k history. They may call us Nazis who cares, life is more important than fake image."" [1]

Rangoli Chandel was followed on Twitter by over 100 thousand people. The tweet remained for everyone to see for almost a whole day. It was retweeted 1497 times and liked by over 5600 people.

Last year, in the wake of the Pulwama attack, Kangana Ranaut had said this of Shabana Azmi and Pakistan:

""The film industry is full of such anti-nationals who boost enemies' morals in many ways, but right now is the time to focus on decisive actions. Pakistan's ban is not the focus, Pakistan's destruction is."" [2]

Earlier this year, the Indian government awarded Kangana Padma Shri, the country's 4th highest civilian honor. 

Following this latest incident, if not a Padma award, it is entirely plausible that Rangoli could at least snag a BJP ticket in an upcoming election.

Yeah Yeah i know its bad form to downplay corona virus right now.

But if the mortality rate is **0.2%** in **10 - 39** range and **0.4%** in **39-40** range then the overall mortality rate would be about **0.32 - 0.35% in under 50 range.**

Why not let people under 50 to go back to work with the obvious restrictions ....compulsory face mask and gloves ....some social distancing ....safeguards like temperature check ...companies that allow only under 50 years aged employees to work and also implement basic safeguards to be allowed to function after getting permission from authorities etc ...

I mean according to \[govt of india figures\]( [http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes\_of\_death\_2001-03.pdf](http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes_of_death_2001-03.pdf)/ )

In the age group 25-69, the leading causes of death in this age group are:

Cardiovascular diseases (25%), ¾

COPD, asthma, other respiratory (10.2%),

Tuberculosis (10.1%),

Malignant and other neoplasms (9%),

Symptoms signs and ill-defined conditions (5.3%),

Digestive diseases (5.1%),

Diarrhoeal diseases (5%)

Unintentional injuries: Other (4.6%),

Intentional self-harm or suicide (3%),

and Malaria (2.8%).

**India** \- **Adult mortality rate** between age 15 and 60

In 2015, **adult mortality rate** for **India** was 31.43 deaths per 100 population.

so even if we end up with 25% of the allowed adult population (0-49 years) infected with corona virus over the next 6 months ....the mortality rate is only 0.35% - which means death toll of 95,000 or 0.007% of population

Keep in mind 90% of corona virus infections are asymptomatic - so only 4-5% of the infected actually end up needing hospitalization.

Ok ....you can shoot me down now and say i am missing the point and have got it all wrong.

Just be gentle.",2020-04-17 18:10:21
