I replied without reading this person\\'s entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I\\'m reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes\\n\\n1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:\\n * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.\\n * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.\\n\\n2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:\\n * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).\\n * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.\\n * \\'Exit\\', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions\\n\\n3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.\\n\\n4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period \"post-liberalisation\" for each economy:\\n * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|\\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\\nKorea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|\\nBGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|\\nThailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|\\nIndonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|\\nMalaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|\\nChina|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|\\nVietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|\\nIndia|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|\\n\\n5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:\\n * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.\\n * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.\\n\\n * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India\\'s domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India\\'s share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)\\n\\n * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.\\n\\n**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I\\'ll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction.

The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard.

I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.\\n\\nA couple more points I'd like to add:\\n\\n* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.\\n* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.\\n\\nSumming up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post.\", '', \"  \\n\\n***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***\\n\\nWe never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. \\n\\nThis pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?\\n\\nBusinesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. \\n\\nRemarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. \\n\\nA critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**\\n\\nStudies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. \\n\\nReal Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.\\n\\n**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**\\n\\n1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.\\n\\n2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.\\n\\n3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   \\n (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.\\n\\n4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.\\n\\n5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.\\n\\nWhile the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: \\n\\n **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. \\n\\n**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.\\n\\n· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**\\n\\n· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.\\n\\n· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. \\n\\n· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.\\n\\n· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.\\n\\n· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own \\n\\n· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \\\\- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!\\n\\n· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \\\\- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \\\\- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!\\n\\n· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.\\n\\n· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.\\n\\n· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.\\n\\n· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.\\n\\n· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.\\n\\n**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**\\n\\nProbably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**\\n\\n1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.\\n\\n2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.\\n\\n3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.\\n\\n4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.\\n\\n5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.\\n\\n6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.\\n\\n7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** \\n\\n**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**\\n\\n\\\\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, \\n\\n\\\\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, \\n\\n\\\\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly \\n\\n\\\\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... \\n\\nSimply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process\\n\\n**The Bottom Line**\\n\\n**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**\\n\\nReal estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.\\n\\n**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN.

Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It\\'s beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don\\'t have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can\\'t afford soaps, can\\'t afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It\\'s also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let\\'s not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his \"brave\" and \"strong\" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he\\xa0discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment\\xa0and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.\\n\\n>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high\\xa0and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low,\\xa0and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.\\n\\n>A\\xa0second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast\\xa0pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.\\n\\nDoes this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .\\n\\nLow inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .\\n\\nDuring Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it \\n\\n\\nThe reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures\\n\\n\\n>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using\\xa0monetary policy. To do so, the\\xa0Federal Reserve\\xa0(the U.S.\\xa0central bank)\\xa0relies\\xa0on the relationship between\\xa0inflation and interest rates. If\\xa0interest rates\\xa0are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging\\xa0animal spirits\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/is-low-inflation-the-culprit-for-indias-economic-woes/articleshow/71190710.cms\", '', \"Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers.

He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  \\n\\nIssues:\\n\\nThere is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.\\nThey fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.\\nLives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.\\nWay ahead:\\n\\nOne way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. \\nThe ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. \\nThe cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.\\nOut-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. \\nThe government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).\\nIn the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.\\nLenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. \\nA credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. \\nSuch a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. \\nThe bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. \\nA GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.\\nThe loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. \\nSuch a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. \\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nThe crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.', '', ' \\n\\n### 1)\\xa0SARS-\\xadCoV-\\xad2\\xa0\\n\\n* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer\\xadreviewed, open\\xadaccess journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS\\xad-CoV-\\xad2, the virus causing the COVID-\\xad19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient\\n* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-\\xad2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID\\xad19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral \\xadfecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.\\n* As part of the research, samples \\xad including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes \\xad In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.\\n* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)\\n* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period\\n* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019\\xadnCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative\\n* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status\\n\\n#### About Coronaviruses\\n\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.\\xa0 In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\\n\\n#### What is COVID-19?\\n\\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.\\n\\n#### About SARS\\n\\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.

The Ministry of Home Affairs vides its notifications dated 12th February 2020 has amended the provisions of the Arms Act, 1959 and the Arms Rules, 2016 to increase the number of firearms that can be kept by the shooters and enhanced the quantity of ammunition fixed for their practice for the year. These provisions shall greatly facilitate their shooting practice.\\n* As per the new rules, now International Medalists/Renowned Shooters are allowed to keep additional weapons up to a total of twelve under the exempted category, which earlier was seven. If a shooter is renowned in one event, he can keep maximum eight (previously it was four), if a shooter is renowned in two events he can keep maximum ten (previously it was seven) and if a shooter is renowned in more than two events, he can keep maximum twelve (previously it was seven) firearms under exempted category. The junior target shooter/ aspiring shooter is now allowed to possess two weapons (previously one) of any category in which the person is a junior target shooter/aspiring shooter. This provision shall facilitate shooters in practicing with various types of firearms. Apart from the above exemptions, the shooters are entitled to possess two firearms as normal citizens under provisions of the Arms Act, 1959.\\n* Similarly, by amending the provision under Rule 40 of the Arms Rules, 2016 the quantity of ammunition that can be purchased by the shooters during the year for the practice has also been increased considerably. As per the new provisions, for .22 LR rifle/pistol 5000 instead of 1000, for another type of Pistol/Revolver 2000 instead of 600 and for shotgun calibers 5000 instead 500 can be purchased by the shooters.\\n* Apart from this, the Ministry of Home Affairs has also made other necessary amendments in the Arms Rules, 2016 by amending the Arms Act, 1959, vide the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019. Through these amendments, it has also been clarified that no license is required for Indian citizens for acquisitions, possession of small arms falling under the category of curio. However, an appropriate license as prescribed would be required for use or to carry or transport such as small arms. Without the endorsement of such firearms in the prescribed license of the owner, no ammunition shall be sold for their use.\\n* It may be noted that as per the provisions of the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019, the maximum number of firearms to be possessed by any person has been reduced from three to two. Those in possession of three firearms have been given the facility to retain any two of such firearms and to deposit the remaining firearm by 13.12.2020.\\n\\nSource: PIB\\n\\n### 10)\\xa0Corporates join Ganga Rejuvenation effort\\n\\n* A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed\\xa0between the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), State Program Management Group-Uttarakhand (SPMG-UK) and Indorama Charitable Trust (ICT) to work together for renovation/ development of the Ghat at Badrinath and Ghats and Crematoria at Gangotri in Uttarakhandat a total cost of 26.64 Crore.\\n* Rivers in India have always been considered sacred and the Ganga river, in particular, is the identity and lifeline of India.

In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.\\n\\nSource\\n\\n\\t2.\\tWhat is the CAA, how can it be misused?\\n\\n(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional\\n\\nThe core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.\\n\\nAre there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?\\n\\nYes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.\\nThis was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:\\n\\n\\nBut by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. \\n\\nThis when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.\\n\\nWhy does this Act violate Article 14?\\n\\nArticle 14 is Equality of Law.\\n\\n‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’\\n\\nThe opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. \\n\\nIn simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.\\n\\nThis matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.\\n\\n(b) How can CAA be misused?\\n\\nCAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. \\n\\nThe government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.\\n\\nHowever, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:\\n\\n\"Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;\" \\n\\n\\n\\nReligious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.\\n\\n\\n*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.\\n\\nCredit:\\n\\n3. What is the NRC?\\n\\nThe National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. \\n\\nThe Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.\\n\\n(a) What is the NPR?\\n\\nThe NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. \\n\\nUnlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.\\n It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.\\n\\nThe NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. \\n\\nFor biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.\\n\\nApart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.\\n\\nEven as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.\\n\\nSource\\n\\n(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?\\n\\nThe legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. \\n\\n(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)\\n\\nThe rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.\\n\\nHow would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: \\n\\n“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”\\n\\nWhen the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. \\n\\nThe final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.\\n\\nThis Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.\\n\\nLink\\n In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.\\n\\nCredits for info on NPR.\\nCredit\\nCredit\\n\\n\\n(c) Arguments against NRC.\\n\\n\\t(i).\\tA botched exercise in Assam\\n\\nThe National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. \\n\\nThe updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.\\n\\nIt was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.\\nSource\\n\\n In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. \\nSource\\n\\nSoon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.\\n\\nSource: BJP complaining about a botched NRC\\nSource: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC\\nSource: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded\\n\\nAnyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.\\nReports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.\\n\\nSource: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.\\n\\n\\n\\t(ii).\\tLoopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws\\n\\nThere is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.\\n\\nBut one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.\\n\\nHow does one prove their citizenship?\\n\\nThis is where matters get complex.\\n\\nIf we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -\\n\\n\\nThe Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:\\n\\nSection 3:\\n\\nCitizenship by birth —\\n\\n(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—\\n(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;\\n\\n(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;\\n\\n(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—\\n(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or\\n(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, \\n\\nshall be a citizen of India by birth.\\n\\nShort of this is,\\n\\nIf you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.\\n\\nIf you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.\\n\\nIf you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.\\n\\nSo if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.\\n\\nIf you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)\\n\\nHow do you do it?\\n\\nIf you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.\\n\\nAssuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.\\n\\n\\nIf you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.\\n\\nYou have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS\\nto prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.\\n\\nMany news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.\\n\\nMere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.\\nSource\\n\\nIn conclusion,\\n67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.\\n\\n\\t(iii).\\tWhy NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?\\n\\nImagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. \\n\\n\\nNow, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants\". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. \\n\\nAs a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.\\n\\nThe tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.\\n\\nTo benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, \\n\\nand, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. \\n\\n*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.\\n\\nCredit:\\n\\n\\t(iv).\\tEconomic cost\\n\\nThe Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.\\n\\nThis is the case with NRC.\\n\\n In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.\\nSource:\\n \\nThe national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.\\n\\nThe estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).\\n\\nSource: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.\\n\\nSay, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.\\n\\nHowever, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. \\n\\nIn Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.\\nSource:\\n\\nA nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.\\n\\nDemonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.\\nSource:.\\n\\nOver 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.\\nSource CMIE report.\\n\\nThe nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.\\n\\n\\t(v).\\tCost of Error\\n\\nThe NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. \\n\\nExplanation:\\n\\nType I errors:  False positives \\n\\nMistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. \\n\\nImmigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. \\n\\nThese costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.\\n\\n\\nType II errors: False negatives\\n\\nThese occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.\\n\\nType II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. \\n\\nAlso, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. \\n\\nThe Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.\\n\\n\\nThere are three main issues to consider here. \\n\\n\\nThe first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. \\n\\nIf, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. \\n\\nOn the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. \\nThe current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.\\n\\n\\nThe third issue is of the magnitude of error.\\n\\n1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)\\n\\n2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.\\n\\n3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)\\n\\nBoth the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.\\n\\n\\nSource:\\nSource:\\n\\n\\nPlease share this with others who may find this information useful and open up discussions with supporters of the CAA bill.\\nHope this helped. Jai Hind!\\n\\n\\nFootnote:\\nOpinion -\\nThere are a lot of narratives around the CAA and NRC but one thing that we need to stress on too is that illegal immigrants coming to India are disenfranchised and very poor. To blanket categorise them as some evil “infiltrators” stealing our lands and jobs is unfair and inhumane.', '', 'https://preview.redd.it/xl5x0otkbfn41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e129292a378cf251da1f916f9dcdf9ed02cb6cbd\\n\\n### Tl;dr\\n\\nAccess to good quality internet has never been more important than right now.

To ensure that high quality bandwidth is available to all parts of India we have suggested specific steps to be taken by the Department of Telecom. \\n\\n### \"We the people...\", of the Internet\\n\\nDue to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union Government is taking various policy measures to safeguard the health and welfare of all Indians as per an advisory by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare titled, “*Advisory on Social Distancing Measure in view of spread of COVID-19 disease*” ([**link**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/SocialDistancingAdvisorybyMOHFW.pdf)). Point number 3 to this advisory recommends to, “*Encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible.*” A “work from home” measure is critical during this time to contain adverse economic impacts on individuals, companies and the entire Indian economy.\\n\\nAt the same time during this period many people are likely to undergo mental stress and will reach out to loved ones for comfort and support. Even for children, remote educational modes of learning will become vital at this time as schools are closed. Many such interests which require social distancing necessary to restrict the spread of Covid-19 are supported by the availability of telecom and data services. However, as is the case with such a measure we would like to highlight that there comes certain network capacity related risks which policymakers must respond to. \\n\\nA recent report in the New York Times, dated March 16, 2020 informs us that a work and learn from home set up, leads to considerable stress on underlying network infrastructure ([**link**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/technology/coronavirus-working-from-home-internet.html)). This is because last mile home service networks are designed to handle traffic patterns which are considerably different to enterprise grade internet broadband networks. Moreover, Wi-Fi based home internet systems have their own set of challenges in terms of reliability and quality of service. \\n\\n### We need to have a plan to support each other\\n\\nWe urge for crucial policy measures by putting forth a comprehensive plan in coordination with appropriate government departments and ministries. We specifically suggest the following:\\n\\n1. **Periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure** **constraints:** There is an urgent need for the DOT and TRAI to conduct assessments in consultation with large telecom and internet service providers on the capacity to carry voice and internet traffic. Separately, there\\'s a need for authorities to engage with representatives from internet users both enterprise facing stakeholders and consumer facing stakeholders in challenges they may face in continuing their day to day activities online. All of these actions must nonetheless, uphold the spirit of net neutrality and not lead to discriminatory treatment of internet traffic.\\n2. **Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies:** We recommend that a voluntary pledge may be encouraged by the Union Government in which telecom and internet service providers decide to not terminate services of any residential or small business users because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused specifically by COVID-19. \\n3. **Ensure full and complete access at all times:** We urge that an advisory may be issued to all State Governments to halt any internet shutdowns or actions under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017 which are likely to increase hardship for people and organisations. This includes measures which slow down internet access speeds since that has the potential cripple economic activities.\\n\\nWe urge people from across the community (especially technical experts and small businesses) on if they have experienced any difficulties whilst accessing the internet, or using voice and video conferencing services. IFF will remain alert to the situation should it develop.\\n\\n### Important Documents\\n\\n1.

The Indians were in every facet of the economy & their expulsion led to a decline in the Ugandan economy. \\n\\nThis is the same for other nationalisation policies such as in Zimbabwe, Kenya & South Africa. In all these cases training the locals with various skills & running businesses and entrepreneurship would have been more helpful and sustainable. Let us learn from their mistakes and train our people.', 'So an year ago, there was some intelligence input that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack. Naturally, they relayed the information over to our honourable Prime Minister the Great Narendra Modi. Now our beautiful Modi was so preoccupied with thinking out policies for the then Budget to boost our economy that he did not pay attention to it. Those stupid intelligence officers should have found a better time to inform our marvellous Modi, like, say, after February 14th.\\n\\nAnyways, the CRPF men were planning to go to Srinagar from Jammu. Our fantastic Modi told them to take 78 vehicles so that the people would not miss the glory that is the Indian Army. Some fools raised possible security threat in going in a conspicuous 78 vehicle convoy. How dare they?! Shouldn\\'t the people of India, especially those antinationalistic Kashmiris, see the glory of our Hindu nation?\\n\\nAnyways, while they were moving, a car laden with explosives rammed into one of the vehicles, and the resulting blast killed 40 of our brave CRPF men. This act of terrorism irked our magnificient Modi, who meditated to let their souls rest in peace. During this meditation, Modi got a divine message. \"Those putrid Pakistanis committed this act. We must punish them.\" Now this was divine, because even after a year, the NIA still has no clue where the bomb came from, while Modi understood it in a fraction of a second.\\n\\nAnyways, our divine Modi swore revenge on the damned Pakistanis, and sent our brave Indian Army to Balakot to kill them. Our Indian Army dropped bombs there, killing several Pakistani terrorists. This was a very valiant move. I heard that a soldier was so brave that he gained the Vir Chakra for bravely getting his plane shot down and getting caught.\\n\\nAnyways, the attack was a success. Exactly 420 terrorists died, including 256 antinational bacteria, 69 anti-Hindu fungi, 42 anti-Indian ferns, 31 anti-democratic trees, 13 Congress lizards, and 9 Muslim Crows. The satellite image in this [Reuters article](https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-india-kashmir-pakistan-airstrike-insi/satellite-images-show-madrasa-buildings-still-standing-at-scene-of-indian-bombing-idINKCN1QN02Z) should show all casualities. If you don\\'t see all of them, including the bacteria, that means you\\'re antinational. Get wrecked by NRC, you filthy Non-Bhakt.\\n\\nAnyways, the intelligent people of India realised that our excellent Modi should rule India for decades to come. They saw that under our admirable Modi, we can regain the glory of our Vedic age, where there were satellites, where people used the internet, where people had nuke-laden arrows, where divine cows cure cancer, where women were trophies to be placed rightfully in kitchens, where we were proud of our caste system, where Dalits knew their place, where there were no Muslims and hence no terrorists, where kingship was hereditary; wait no, kingship can\\'t be hereditary otherwise we\\'d be no different from those crazy Congressmen and even crazier Congresswomen, to say nothing of Congress-transgenders. So the Vedic age wasn\\'t perfect, after all. Huh. You learn new things every day.\\n\\nAnyways, this is my belief of what really happened in Pulwama. Hindustan zindabad.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nPS: /s for those who are incapable of understanding sarcasm. I\\'m just sad that 40 brave CRPF men died for Modi\\'s selfish ambitions.', \"Before the deluge of talking heads and op-eds overwhelm you with their thoughts, here's a rough guide to independently understand \\nwhat the budget and Economic Survey are saying. Source: am research scholar in Economics. \\n\\n1. Listen to the whole budget speech or read the transcript online (usually available on a ministry website after a few hours). Dealing directly with the budget speech is the best way not to be swayed by random claims.\\n\\n2. Filter through the hawa-baazi. A good chunk of the budget speech will be dedicated to singing the government's praises. Ignore all of that; the budget is as much a political speech as it is an economic one.  Do make a note of what they claim to have done though, in order to cross-check later. \\n\\n3. Most crucially, listen to how they intend to fund any new schemes. Are they going to increase taxes? Will they just give out loans via PSBs? Do they hope to draw on CSR resources? Will they divert funds from existing schemes?  There are typically two parts to the budget speech: Part A and Part B. Part A is mostly what they intend to do, Part B is mostly about how they intend to raise the funds for it; i.e. the taxation tweaks. Part B in my opinion is more important, as the how of these schemes is as important as the why. \\n\\n4. Listen to multiple commentary sources. Big business interests will obviously praise any budget that makes their life easier, and will also obviously praise the government in general to facilitate easy business. Thus: question anything that they say without highlighting specific plus points. The same applies to government critics, professors etc: They (myself included) have biases that lend themselves to automatically assuming the worst of any decision made. \\n\\n5. Don't overhype the budget. Between data manipulation and upcoming elections, the budget is no longer the significant economic blueprint that it once was. The same applies to the Economic Survey. It is important, but no longer sufficient to gauge the direction of the economy and the government's economic policies.\", \"I just came across an interesting [article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3xgq5/why-wont-twitter-treat-white-supremacy-like-isis-because-it-would-mean-banning-some-republican-politicians-too) by vice news. I will paste excerpts from it here  for the context:   \\n\\n\\n>Though Twitter has rules against “abuse and hateful conduct,” civil rights experts, government organizations, and Twitter users say the platform hasn’t done enough to [curb white supremacy and neo-Nazis](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xnn8b/web-hosting-companies-shut-down-a-series-of-neo-nazi-websites) on the platform, and its competitor Facebook recently [explicitly banned white nationalism](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nexpbx/facebook-bans-white-nationalism-and-white-separatism). Wednesday, during a [parliamentary committee hearing on social media content moderation](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/24/mps-criticise-tech-giants-for-failure-to-report-criminal-posts-twitter-facebook-google-youtube), UK MP Yvette Cooper asked Twitter why it hasn’t yet banned former KKK leader David Duke, and “Jack, ban the Nazis” has [become a common reply](https://twitter.com/search?q=to%3Ajack%20ban%20the%20nazis&src=typd) to many of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s tweets. [During a recent interview with TED](https://www.fastcompany.com/90335799/jack-dorsey-defends-twitter-anti-abuse-ai-in-heated-ted) that allowed the public to tweet in questions, the feed was overtaken by people asking Dorsey why the platform hadn’t banned Nazis. Dorsey said “we have policies around violent extremist groups,” but did not give a straightforward answer to the question. Dorsey did not respond to two requests for comment sent via Twitter DM.\\n\\n.....\\n\\n>The argument that external experts made to Motherboard aligns with what the Twitter employee aired: Society as a whole uncontroversially and unequivocally demanded that Twitter take action against ISIS in the wake of beheading videos spreading far and wide on the platform. The automated approach that Twitter took to eradicating ISIS was successful: “I haven’t seen a legit ISIS supporter on Twitter who lasts longer than 15 seconds for two-and-a-half years,” Amarnath Amarasingam, an extremism researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told Motherboard in a phone call. Society and politicians were willing to accept that some accounts were mistakenly suspended by Twitter during that process (for example, accounts [belonging to the hacktivist group Anonymous](https://www.theepochtimes.com/hackers-say-twitter-isnt-telling-the-whole-story-about-anti-terror-fight_1983519.html) that were reporting ISIS accounts to Twitter as part of an operation called #OpISIS were themselves banned).\\n\\nThe aftermath of the Delhi pogroms looks just as grim as the riots,  the only good thing being the absence of blood bath. The fascist forces are running campaigns titled SupportHinduEconomy, and its no surprise their proposal is to boycott of Muslim businesses esp in the riot affected areas. They post many deplorable things and I'll paste some of them here.   \\n\\n\\n>If you are a hindu then don't give your money to terrorist to spread terrorism.  To support Hindu and Hindu Economy always bought from hindus.    \\n>  \\n>Stop calling M electrician in house call Hindu electrician only. \\n\\nI can paste hundreds of such tweets ( this campaign has garnered 85.4k tweets) and I'm sorry if it makes you feel sick in the gut like it does to me.   \\nTwitter's inaction on these accounts makes me more worried. Twitter is excessively used to promote nazi like ideology here in India. Many of these campaigns are paid and Twitter is also a beneficiary of these campaigns.   \\nHow can we make twitter more accountable here in India? My first suggestion would be for twitter to filter hate speech independently and block those accounts like it used to block ISIS' accounts.\", \"https://preview.redd.it/w3igtx7vnlj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d61bc619966e39747319b263d1e649d649382a\\n\\n**Tl;dr**\\n\\nIFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.   \\n\\n\\n**Essential First Principles**\\n\\nAs a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (*KS Puttaswamy v Union of India*) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  \\n\\n\\nIn addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the [**seven privacy principles**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.   \\n\\n\\n**Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee**\\n\\nSubsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:  \\n\\n\\n*1. \\xa0 \\xa0Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill*\\n\\nThe Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. **We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill**.  \\n\\n\\n*2.* \\xa0 *Need for a chapter on surveillance reform*\\n\\nPresently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. **Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018**.  \\n\\n\\n*3.* \\xa0 *Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data*\\n\\nA provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. **We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data**.  \\n\\n\\n*4. \\xa0 Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure*\\n\\n* The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). **Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation**.\\n* We have noted that the Bill **impairs the independence of the DPA** by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.\\n* To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having **state and regional DPA benches**.\\n* We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have **proposed that it must publish all its decisions**.   \\n\\n\\n*5.* \\xa0 *The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.*\\n\\nThe exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “**reasonable purposes**” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this **provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces**.  \\n\\n\\nIn addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.  \\n\\n\\n**Important Documents**\\n\\n1.

Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.\\n\\nFascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).\\n\\nThis is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.\\n\\nThis is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.\\n\\nWhy abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.\\n\\n*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*\\n\\nOkay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”\\n\\nFrom our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.\\n\\nThe fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.\\n\\nWe fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.\\n\\nIf you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.\\n\\nAnd we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do.

Can the bhakts say so?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**\\n\\nReligious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies.

Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”.

In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.\\n\\nAnd oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics?

In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”\\n\\nThus they justified the Holocaust.\\n\\nJustifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.\\n\\nWe can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.\\n\\n*Ahimsa* is the word I believe.', '', \"Okay, so this is my first ever post on reddit. I have been a keen observer of Indian politics since the last 6 years. I was a voter who voted for BJP in good faith thinking that they are different from other parties. But since the last few years my view point has completely changed. But this post won't discuss about the actions of BJP that led to the change in my political stance, but this would rather be a post about what is the real problem with the BJP supporters. \\n\\nI might be wrong here but here are some of my observations from my personal experience. \\n\\n1.) BJP fans simply don't understand that you can simultaneously oppose two political parties. As soon as you start debating them on a certain issue, they will straight away associate you with congress, communists or even with a terrorist. They believe that every one who is against BJP has joined a faction. \\n\\n2.) Staunch BJP fans certainly don't realize that a person isn't against the nation if they are against BJP.  They just rebrand you anti national even if you ask logical questions on government policies. These people are forgetting that we have every right to question the government and protest if we don't think something is right. That is what distinguishes us from a country like North Korea or Saudi Arabia. We do not have a king, rather we have a prime minister who is responsible for answering us. \\n\\n3.) BJP supporters tend to discredit each and every source which criticizes the government. These people are just not ready to accept the fact that someone who is not affiliated to any political party can criticize the government. If a post or a newspaper article condemns the government, they simply start calling it anti Indian or congress sponsored propaganda. \\n\\n4.) BJP supporters also use a tool called Whataboutism. They justify their wrongdoing by referring to the wrongdoing of other parties. For example, okay BJP is corrupt but what about congress it was more corrupt. But they do not understand that this does not change the fact that even BJP is corrupt, and if you are trying to bring positive changes you cannot repeat the same mistakes that your predecessors have made. \\n\\n5.) BJP supporters can't accept the fact that a person can do both constructive and destructive work. I agree that BJP has also brought in some positive changes, but that doesn't justify its wrongdoing. You can appreciate and criticize a person at the same time. Just because you have voted for them shouldn't make them immune to your criticism. You chose them to represent you, you have every right to criticize their actions and appreciate any good work. \\n\\n6.) Even if they can clearly see that BJP is playing communal politics, they will turn a blind eye to it. They say congress played a dirtier one, again whataboutism at its best. Congress played communal politics, that is the reason you voted against them. But if the new party also starts doing the same how can you support them only on the basis of your vote.  \\n\\n7.) As soon as a communal card is played like mandir the BJP fans will always deviate from real issues like economy, poverty, economic reforms, business investments. Their first priority will become to resolve that petty issue rather than the real ones. \\n\\n\\nSo my thoughts on this issue is that in this day and age we are still fighting for the issues that the British wanted us to fight on. Religion, once upon a time it was used to unite people but right now it is only playing a divisive role. We as the modern generation have to stop taking pride in our religion and just not get emotional while voting on the basis of your religion. It does not matter whatever degree you have because if you caste your votes on the basis of just being from a particular religion then the value of getting that education goes to zero. Don't let social media dictate your perspective, do your own research and make your own mindset rather than following the mindset of the crowd. \\n\\nI would seriously like you guys to give your insight on this post.

But, assessing the current political situation has made me impromptu promptly write this.\\nI\\'m not here to be a keyboard warrior by bashing the fascist leader and gain karma out of it.\\nInstead, I\\'ll lay down a plan to tackle the current regime. It only deals with their propaganda power since it has time and again proven that propaganda plays a major role in convincing people to support or commit atrocities.

As a sound citizen, we need you to get our situation to be heard globally (like the HongKong protest). Henceforth, Fella redditors with high karma and eloquent writing skills. Do post articles, videos, engage in group discussions happening in global subs like world news, Politics and many more. Subs that has their presence in the front page.\\nUse your meme knowledge, post and repost memes to subs like memes, dank meme, meme economy and so on.\\n\\n2) WhatsApp is the breeding ground for BJP propaganda. Inorder to counter this, we need you to post videos highlighting the hypocrisy of this party. Especially the ones that OFFICIAL PEEING HUMAN uploads. Tweet him asking for an offline download link of his vidoes. Or do download it by illegal means ( anything illegal for greater good is good).\\nDo not post link to the videos. Mid-life crisis unkills and aunties won\\'t open the link and watch it. Even if they did, not gonna watch more than 5 seconds. They are brainwashed in thinking Modi is the superman that\\'s gonna save their arse from monotonous life. Do not send them to a liberal\\'s den. They identify themselves as Bhakt due to the sheer propaganda and will refute to believe any of it. Hence, remove the doctrine slowly. Administer the truth little by little in their silly heads. Truth is, if they can be brainwashed to an extend that can support this regime without giving any batshit about the trend of the country. They can be rewired to think in the right way as well. Sharing offline videos in WhatsApp groups will definitely make them watch it accidentally atleat once. Since, they are prone to clicking it on their Phone Gallery.  Apparently,most of them don\\'t care to even delete it later.\\n\\nYou will obviously face criticism from your family, friends and acquaintances by sharing the videos in their WhatsApp Group. Calm your nerves down. Do not engage in a rebuttal with them. Keep posting every hour every day. Things will change. People who blindly supported the party\\'s claims will progressively begin to think about it. They may not change their stand an overnight, a week, a month or forever. But will definitely cross think about the situation. And will not start shouting slogans praising this fascist regime.\\nDo add photos and videos highlighting great leaders,celebrities,experts of any field expressing their opinions. Do quote Golden words said by past leaders and dictators regarding the fascism.\\nShare pictures of scientific data and statistics highlighting the economic growth, unemployment     trend and so on. \\n\\nMight seem like a silly thing to do. But things like these are definitely the ones that pulled them in supporting BJP in the first place.\\n\\n3) Eloquent writers of this sub.

I swing both directions on economic and social issues, but am strongly liberal and progressive on civil liberties. If someone labels me leftist, i would say - not entirely true, but sometimes I'm pretty leftist. With being labeled socialist, I would disagree more assertively, citing my strong inclinations towards a healthy mixed economy and market driven solutions to socio-economic problems. But if I was to be labeled Communist or Naxalite, I would vehemently disagree. I'm sure there are some overlaps between these ideologies and mine, but that way I'll have some overlaps with almost all ideologies in the world. So there's a spectrum on the left side of politics, which is well understood widely. Like me, most leftists don't identify with being communist or naxalite.\\n\\nNow, right of centre politics, which is having a bit of a peak moment globally at the moment, is bound to have similar diversity and differentiation. But this differentiation is not as well understood, perhaps because Indian right has not been as dominant historically as it has been lately, so people haven't caught up yet. In case of the Modi-Shah government, a lot of people voted for them in the 2014 general elections because of the anti-corruption and development narrative they campaigned with, and because of the national security issue which peaked following Pulwama attack and Balakot airstrikes. These people may be supporters of market-driven economic reforms, may want a break from the status quo of structural corruption in the Indian state, may aspire towards a more assertive foreign policy and may desire a more proactive law and order regime. These are issues which many pragmatic liberals and leftists would also support. I, myself support many of this government's foreign, security and environmental policies. Can't say the same for this government's economic policies and civil liberties record. Anyone who doesn't see the plight of the Indian economy is delusional.\\n\\nComing back to the topic, most of the BJP voters may not support the RSS agenda or consider Modi an avatar of Vishnu. But nonetheless, in the everyday online discourse, anyone supporting Modi or government's policy is labeled as Modi-cultist (b word) or belonging to RSS (s word). These terms have been misused so much that they have become meaningless. (But at least  they are not as obscene as the terms that the right uses against left) This distinction between moderates and extremists on the right needs to be acknowledged and understood. The extremists on the Indian right subscribe to the Savarkarite ideology of radical majoritarian nationalism, which they try to link with Hinduism, by calling it Hindutva. The extremist Savarkarites are the ones who indulge in conspiracy theories of global islamic takeover, and that 'sab mile hue hain' - students, congress, aap, muslims, bollywood, global media (even Pak and Dawood). They act as if questioning our own government in a democracy is a crime. These Savarkarites are violently anti-Gandhian, so they are ready to justify any means, as long as the ends are as per their ideology. They are ok with democratic institutions being destroyed so that their leader wins,  hundreds dying because of demonetisation, regular Kashmiris suffering because of some extremist elements, innocent students being shot at because of vandalism done by others, and so on.\\n\\nThis extremist faction of the right is the real danger to our nation, and to whom most liberal leftists are strongly opposed. These Savarkarites interpret the BJP manadate to mean that majority of the country supports their extremists views of establishment of Hindu Rashtra, demonization of Muslims and one-party state in India. They forget that 65 % of Indians didn't vote for BJP, and even among the 35% that did,  many don't support their extremist agenda. These spontaneous, peaceful protests by lakhs of students in every single part of the country has proven that these Savarkarites are delusional. India is strongly pluralistic and will vehemently oppose the bigoted agenda that they subscribe to. And these lakhs of protestors are more opposed to violence than these extremist Savarkarites, and are heart-broken when some miscreants turn towards violence. Violent and extremist elements on both sides should be punished by the due process of law. Jai Hind!\\n\\nP.S: Those who see the world only through one lens will wonder if I'm a muslim.

Sept 1 2019.*\\n\\nThe state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter’s GDP growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown.\\n\\nIt is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. Domestic demand is depressed. And consumption growth is at an 18 month low. Nominal GDP growth is at 15 year low.\\n\\nThere is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded, and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiment are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recovery.\\n\\nThe Modi government’s policies are resulted in massive jobless growth. More than 3.5 lakh Jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers.\\n\\nRural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.\\n\\nInstitutions are under attack, and their autonomy is being eroded. The resilience of the Reserve Bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 1.76 lakh crore to the government, which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall. In addition, the credibility of India’s data has come under question under this government.\\n\\nBudget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government.\\n\\nOur youth, our farmers and our farm workers, entrepreneurs, and the marginalised section deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the Government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.', '', 'What bizzaro world are we in where this is something to be celebrated.\\n\\nDo people not understand that the majority of these \"funds\" will be spent on stock buybacks and higher bonuses?

And all you morons that celebrate this.', 'With the \"OK Boomer\" memes becoming popular, I\\'ve noticed a lot of Indians blindly picking up American boomer arguments and using it in Indian context. The arguments go something to the tune of - you had the best of times, the best jobs, social security, economic growth and are now becoming an impediment to education subsidies and liberal policies that will benefit the present youth.\\n\\nIn the Indian context, these arguments are only partially true. Firstly, the word boomer refers to baby boomers generation born post WW-II (1946-1964). This was the period where the great health-care became accessible to everyone in developed nations and the child mortality dropped fast. However, the birth-rates remained relatively high (though decreasing) and this led to high number of kids being born. This was the golden period of American growth - women and boomers then joined labor force and there was a great productivity rise in labor. Middle-class grew and moved to sub-urbs and could live that idylic existence with benefits of big cities as well as countryside. Boomers led a positive existence - not just that, because the birth-rates decreased subsequently, boomers also had disproportionate power as a voting block (which was bolstered by the fact that the voting % in boomers is much higher than in subsequent generations too). So, they could bring about and keep laws which were in line with their values but were old-fashioned according to their successors. Moreover, older people living on savings hate increase in inflation that comes with debt-fueled government spendings. So, it was natural for this generation to be debt hawks which also meant opposition to subsidies which led to rise in education debt amongst younger generation.Hence, it is a legitimate cause of angst for politically savvy young people who are forced to live in a society controlled by the oldies who support arcane laws (against abortion for instance) and go against their benefits (education subsidies).\\n\\nHowever, India has a completely different demographic profile. Purely, in terms of being the largest generation, we are the boomers of India. We were born around or just before the high growth post-liberalization India, have opportunities (in terms of private sector jobs, access to information) that the older generation did not have (boomers had booming economy whereas their parents had depression and war). Even as a political block, the young people have the biggest electoral power amongst all generations (a power that was partially harnessed by BJP when they won two elections). Moreover, with the dropping birth-rates in India, we would also grow old in an era of depressed population growth where we continue to be the most influential generation - just like the boomers!\\n\\nHowever, it is also true that the older generation is more bigoted, religiously/caste-wise minded than us and have a role in morally bankrupt polity in this country. There is some blame that we can certainly lay on the older generation. But, the whole boomer spiel of the west wherein the millennial generation claims that the boomers had a much better life and are now actively spoiling the present and future of current youth is certainly not applicable here. Our parents\\' generation had a life of scarcity in terms of resources and opportunities. Even if you are not interested in reading history or talking to your parents, just watch movies - heroes or characters who were struggling to find work, were getting rejected because they could not pay bribes were part of every story. Apart from government jobs, any city apart from tier-I had little to no opportunities in the license-raj era. Statistically, there was lower economic growth and more poverty.\\n\\nTo see the claims about the older generation led a great life is ridiculous. However, it is true that the young need to break free of the religious and caste fundamentalism that the older generation were a victim of due to their lack of exposure and programming.', \"### \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7mv86kazrfg41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8f2d2839802afc223f409a31c337514b1e33c9b\\n\\n### Tl;dr\\n\\nIFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.\\n\\n### Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss\\n\\nMuch has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. \\n\\n### Recommendations \\n\\nIn order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.\\n\\n1. The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.\\n2. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.\\n3. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.\\n4. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.\\n5. Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.\\n\\n### Read the public brief and engage with the JPC\\n\\nFor more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.\\n\\nIf you are a trade union or employee association which needs more information about the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, please feel free to reach out to us at policy@internetfreedom.in.

While he was explaining, he was simultaneously watching the road. He had a view of the road ahead. He spotted two SUVs parked across the road, as if to block it. He saw half a dozen people standing in front of it. His heart skipped a beat.\\n\\nHis body stiffened, and Shweta felt it. \\n\\n“What’s wrong?” she asked\\n\\n“Nothing, just give me a minute” he said\\n\\nHe kept looking around and found a seat beside another girl in the back. He immediately got up.\\n\\n“You should move there” he said, pointing at the empty seat.\\n\\n“Okay, you’re just acting weird now. Why should I move?” she asked in a high pitch\\n\\n“Don’t ask questions, please! Just go there!” he said as he grabbed her hand and almost forcefully lead her to the seat. He only had a moment to look at her face and he felt bad.\\n\\n“Okay, I’ll explain everything later. Just don’t worry. Sit tight and you’ll be fine” he said\\n\\nShe pulled him back, standing midway between the seat they were sitting in and the seat he had chosen. They felt the bus slow down further, she had to hold on to the rails on the ceiling. \\n\\n“I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s going on!” she hissed\\n\\nSumit looked around, and while some were staring at what was soon appearing to be a mob blocking the road, some were staring at them. Sumit figured he still had some seconds before they got in. He grabbed her hand and took her to the seat they had been sitting in.\\n\\n“We don’t have time. But this is the issue. I’m circumcised. They look like RSS mobs and they normally check the guys for this. If they see that you’re with me, they’ll assume you are a muslim too. I’ll manage, it’s okay” he whispered to her. \\n\\nShweta took a few moments to register what she just heard, while she saw Sumit’s face turn scarlet.

There’s no point” he interrupted her.\\n\\nThey heard voices, and he forcefully grabbed her hand and took her to the other seat. He ran back to his, and Shweta could see his back was stiff. She was crying but realised that she couldn’t do anything at this point.\\n\\nShe saw two men barge inside the bus with wooden clubs and she could even see knife handles, from the knives tucked into their pants. One man was remarkably tall, with a thick beard and had a saffron towel around his neck.

The government keeps insisting that they have no hand in this, but it is the work of “miscreants” that they aren’t able to control.\\n\\nStarting with the protests that erupted in the erstwhile India at the end of 2019, it soon emerged that the BJP after winning their second election with a landslide, were now enacting their core ideologies. \\n\\nIn Social Media, Narendra Modi always appeared to be a man who treated everyone equally. However, it was in rallies that his actual persona could be seen. Millions watched helplessly as he brainwashed thousands every week. The BJP realised that all they needed was to brainwash the gullible. To tell them that Hinduism was under threat. That our country was going to the Muslims. \\n\\nMuslims were accused so many things. The economy bad? They blamed it on them. They accused muslims of impersonating Hindus to get away and practice their religion secretly. This rumour became more widespread when Muslims were left stateless after the National Registry of Citizens was introduced in 2020. \\n\\nSo many protested, but turns out they weren’t enough. Protests weren’t the only thing required. People needed to un-brainwashed. People needed a good pair of spectacles to see clearly. \\n\\nThe hard truth was, the number of people who believed in “Hindutva” outnumbered the others and this kept BJP in power. The BJP knew - all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in India.\\n\\n\\\\---', \"Hello, im a student named Aaron, working in partnership with teach for india and i hope to improve education inequality aswell as education overall for less privileged children. I was wondering if the poeple of this subreddit could share some of their experiences teaching and attending STATE schools in India. Could you also share the issues no matter how small or big with the education policies regarding all education ( including the universities such as JEE-IIT) . So far, we have been to two churches in the UK where we held coffee mornings and sold home made Indian food to raise money for the charity and to spread awareness of the issues. So far we have raised around £150 and gotten the churches to include it in their local newspapers and leaflets. \\n\\nIf you have provided issues, thank you very much!\\n\\nI'd also like for potential solutions you believe would have great impacts on educations as a whole in India. These could be solutions you have heard/seen being used in countries similar to India (culture/economic) such as China as they share many educational viewpoints and are both emerging economies.\\n\\nIf you wish to donate, I have also set up a gofundme page :\\n https://www.gofundme.com/f/team-shiksha?utm_source=whatsapp&utm_medium=chat&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1\\n\\nThank you for taking  the time to read my post\", 'Here is the original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcquo0/serious_emigration_threat_is_it_helpless_yet/\\n\\nAs a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. \\n\\ntl:dr; I won\\'t be back as of now! May be in future!\\n\\nLong version:\\n\\nu/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.\\n\\nInfrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it\\'s over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.\\n\\nRide bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That\\'s the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.\\n\\nPlease make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.\\n\\nHealthcare:  \\nHealthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.\\n\\nHave you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don\\'t puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.\\n\\n- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! \\n\\nYou know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.\\n\\nAcademics: \\nThe plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don\\'t get me started on quality of education. Why can\\'t govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.\\n\\nIn Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can\\'t even imagine and that too almost free! \\n\\nYou can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?\\n\\nPolicies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT\\'s and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! \\n\\nMe, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don\\'t want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It\\'s a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!\\n\\nEmployment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!\\n\\nMy brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him.

You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!\\n\\n- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays\\n- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht\\'s!\\n- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. \\n- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.\\n- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It\\'s my right. I dont do it, just saying.\\n- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.\\n- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. \\n- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.\\n- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.\\n- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. \\n\\nLastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don\\'t know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST\\'s and that too without reservation. \\n\\nWhy would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!\\n\\nEdit: If anyone needs help with any issues like job, education just message me. I would be happy to help.', 'The primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.\\n\\nTo return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.\\n\\nIn principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ’the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time\\xa0the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.', \"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. \\n\\nA virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. \\n\\nThe implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.\\n\\nThe importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. \\n\\n\\nThey survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. \\n\\nHaving very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.\\n\\nThe survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. \\n\\nIt'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.\", 'We see poor people everywhere in this country, sometimes right in front of some extremely rich and posh areas, we see beggars trying to get a meal a day in front of the same malls where we throw away half of the expensive mall food we eat.

It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***\\n\\nReservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India\\'s inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a \"*necessary evil*\" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.\\n\\nReservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.\\n\\nThe Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren\\'t allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren\\'t allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.\\n\\nWhy am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. \\n\\nIt is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.', 'To be honest, I feel this post applies to those who pay tax (regardless of which slab), I’m just putting stuff from my perspective.\\n\\nThere are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. \\n\\nNow tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. \\n\\nThe government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... \\nInstead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.\\n\\nWorse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.\\n\\nEDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.', '', '', \"India's economy is going down which is a serious concern for all of us.\\n\\nWhere are we doing wrong?

It has to be low skill, high-volume in order to employ a large number of people. India's current manufacturing pattern is mostly filled with high-skill, low employment products like jewellery, medicine, cars, and software.\\n\\nIt's far easier to train 10,000 people to make iPhone accessories than it is to get them to make cars.\\n\\nBut this kind of high-volume, low skill manufacturing isn't coming to India, regardless of any policy push from the government. \\n\\nA few reasons why:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. Competitors in SE Asia a) have specialized in certain products (like garments in Bangladesh), b) have fewer roadblocks to investment from the populace (they are autocracies or pseudo-democracies), and c) have a cultural affinity with China (such as Vietnam) which makes it easier for Chinese manufacturers to move shop there.\\n2. Businesses are built on relationships, not just policy leverage. Policy makers don't get this because very few of them have ever run businesses. By now, American businesses have had decade-long relationships with their Chinese manufacturers. These Chinese manufacturers are now building factories in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If you were an American business, who would you rather partner with - an unknown entity in India, or the Vietnamese arm of the Chinese manufacturer you know and trust?\\n3. Supply chains are hard to build and harder to optimize. If you wanted to be a manufacturing power in 2020, you would have had to start work for it in 2015, not 2019. We've lost that moment.\\n4. India's regional inequality means that the states with cheap labor (Bihar, UP) are also the states where no one wants to invest in because of law and order problems\\n5. India's democracy means that everything becomes much more challenging for a manufacturer - land acquisition, labor issues, etc. Vietnam, meanwhile, can bulldoze whatever the hell it wants to bulldoze and put up a red carpet for manufacturers.\\n6. And this might be a biased personal take, but I've felt that Indian manufacturers don't have business competence. I've tried to build products in India as well as China. Our Chinese partners treated us as a small company that might later be a big company, and gave us that respect and priority. Our Indian partner treated us as a small fry and was more keen on getting short-term profit than build a long-term relationship.\\n\\nI feel that the moment where India could be a manufacturing power is past us. \\n\\nWithout manufacturing, you'll have a situation where:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. The state has to spend more and more on welfare to tackle unemployment among a young population\\n2. To pay for this welfare, the state will increasingly overreach in tax collection. You're seeing this already where a small section of the population pays nearly all the taxes.\\n3. The small portion of people who have good jobs will be increasingly resentful of their taxes being spent on welfare. This, coupled with environmental issues, will accelerate brain drain and capital flight.\\n4. Without the capital and manpower, employment generation will be even slower, forcing the state to squeeze even more. If the welfare dole stops, it knows there is going to be widespread unrest. \\n5. All this welfare will tax the state exchequer more and more. We're seeing this already - the government has hit its fiscal deficit target for the year in just 7 months. \\n6.

For example -\\n\\n1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.\\nBecause the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.\\nThe manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.\\n\\n2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.\\n\\n3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.\\n\\n4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.\\nYet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.\\n\\n5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.\\n\\n\\nI don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?\\n\\nAnd before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.\", \"Before getting bombarded, let me say that it is what if scenario which is rather pessimistic but a possibility nonetheless, and I vehemently believe that we are facing growth recession if not outright recession as of now. \\n\\n1) Lack of new job creation, decrease in purchasing power, negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation, 2-3% gdp growth rate, if we calculate gdp using previous base year, has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession.

We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.\\n\\nThe principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.\\n\\n**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.\\n\\nWe believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:\\n\\n1. The primacy of fundamental human rights\\n2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.\\n\\n**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**\\n\\nThis is a 50-year project.\\n\\nThe RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.\\n\\nOur goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.\\n\\n**Metrics driven**\\n\\nWe will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:\\n\\n1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)\\n2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)\\n3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)\\n4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)\\n5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)\\n6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)\\n7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)\\n8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)\\n9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)\\n10. Gender equality report (87/144)\\n\\nWe will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.\\n\\n**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**\\n\\nCapitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.\\n\\n**We are committed to internal democracy**\\n\\nAs a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.\\n\\n**National security**\\n\\nWe will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.\\n\\n**Caste and reservations**\\n\\nWe absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.\\n\\nOver 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.\\n\\nOur approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.\\n\\n**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**\\n\\nWe believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.\\n\\nIndividuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.\\n\\n**Science and business**\\n\\nWe will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.\\n\\n**Join us or improve us**\\n\\nIf this is a vision that appeals to you, please become a member. If you strongly disagree with any of these points, please do not become a member. Instead, you could follow our page and share your views from time to time, to help us from the outside think through our positions more rigorously. For those who do join, please do so on the understanding that this is a long term mission and we are not here to compete in the 2024 elections but to win in 2069. This will require us to work with communities and understand them as a social organization first. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. If you would like a more immediate impact on politics then you might find it more rewarding to join an existing political party that most closely resonates with your values.\\n\\n**Our eventual goal is to contribute towards the building of a happy, prosperous, clean, green, safe, and united country.**\\n\\nSatyamev Jayate.\", 'This is another sort of rant about a bad policy by the government. Id first like to clear something up. I’m NOT against mandatory  CSR. I personally don’t like the very idea of mandatory CSR but since it’s law, our company fully complies with all CSR requirements. It’s just the way the government is amending it to make non compliance a criminal offense that is problematic. Let me explain: \\n\\nWhen a corporation is profitable, it pays corporate tax. On top of that, it generates jobs and wealth for individuals and provides valuable goods and services. This boosts the economy. When companies do CSR, they are essentially doing social service and there is nothing wrong in that. \\n\\nThe problem is why the bloody hell does the government want to criminalize it? I know that non compliance is an issue but this just makes it an additional headache for companies. The compliance officer may not have the same view of CSR as companies do and will eventually end up harassing us. Since there is no concrete framework for CSR i.e. what is and what isn’t CSR, it is largely open to interpretation. And if the government puts another bureaucrat they’ll have absolutely no idea on CSR. \\n\\nIn fact, I don’t even understand why the government is doing this. The last time I checked, CSR compliance is at 91.25%. There are certain policies (such as the tax on the super rich) which is vote bank politics but this effectively starts an ‘inspector raj’ all over again. \\n\\nAnd if companies have left over money for CSR, we have to deposit in an escrow account after 3 years?! We are not criminals. We WILL eventually use that money. The government is literally putting its hand in our pockets! This is a sad state of affairs. We aspire to be a 5 trillion dollar economy. The government wants ‘animal spirit’. And the ease of doing business here is being dragged down.', 'Every election I see all political parties propose their manifestos - the things they plan to implement. These manifestos are mostly made by the respective parties in consultation with their party heads, which as everyone knows are filthy rich people, and who are most often disillusioned by the pains of the poor and masses. Hence, I do not understand why they fight an election on (false) promises they find suitable to make to us.\\n\\nInstead, they should ask the common man, what to implement and what not to. But since that is not going to happen IMO, we should instead make a manifesto and ask them to fulfil our needs.\\n\\nI have prepared a mini-manifesto by myself.

But IMO the points I have already mentioned will help in bettering both somehow.\\n\\nAlso, it may seem to some that I have proposed establishing/purchasing a lot of things, and it may seem like a drain on the economy. But IMO those are some basic necessities for the much-touted Super Power, which itself is a welfare state, to begin with.\\n\\nOne more thing I want to address is that I staunchly believe in HIGHER TAXES for Billionaires and Millionaires.

I think no one will disagree that a Billionaire doesn\\'t work more than an employee of his/her company. He/she just happened to make money by making others work for him.\\n\\nAnd from the little economics I have read, even these rich people need poor, middle-class people to buy their stuff. If the current trend continues, poor will not be able to afford their products which will eventually end up lowering these billionaires wealth. And all the people advocating for Capitalism, kindly look at the USA. Capitalism has sucked it hollow. Millions do not have homes, they sleep in their cars.

What this company offered me was 10 lacs annualy with the gross coming out to be 80k per month.

I remember it was the first telecom company that came into our small town, it provided very good service for that time, it was relatively cheap and reliable. It was also the first 3g provider in our area.\\n* But somehow, quality of its services went downhill over the years,nowadays the network goes down in my area very frequently due to some fiber optic cut, or sometimes something gets stolen from the tower premises and nobody seems to care.\\n* Everybody in my town had at least one BSNL sim which they used, but after the disruptions everyone got frustrated and switched to other providers.\\n* At the time of 3g allotment, BSNL was forced to take the spectrum in all circles by matching highest bid price in that circle. I don't understand why couldn't the govt give the spectrum for free in the first place. After all it's a govt entity, and everybody must have known it would kill BSNL.\\n* The government didn't even allocate 4g spectrum to BSNL, it was like the final nail in the coffin.\\n\\nEdit!\\n\\n* Many of you are looking at BSNL as a separate non government for profit entity, which i don't, I see it as publicly owned utility which is an absolute must for our modern times, not just for remote or non profitable areas but for every location in the country.\\n* BSNL wasn't as bad as some may believe, it was definitely not up to the mark like Airtel, but it wasn't as bad for that time, we never had network outage of any kind, and was cheap too. It went from average to worse in the last decade only.\\n* The argument that free spectrum for BSNL may seem unfair for private companies, i would have accepted that if we had a truly free market economy, we never had one, free market in our country only exists for a very few oligarchs, it is used by the govt at its whim.\\n* I will give you an example, take the case of India Post, it's a PSU and a very well functioning PSU, should we have charged some license fee for it to operate? We have a perfectly good model how shipping and courier companies work in India, they work just fine alongside IndiaPost. Unlike the IndiaPost's case, telecom spectrum is a limited resource so we need a barrier for the entry, but private companies should have survived that too by limiting the amount of services BSNL can provide.\\n* Also, BSNL wasn't in any sort of bad shape before the 3g spectrum drama, it wasn't in debt, it had huge reserves, to the tunes of 35000 crore which the govt forcibly took from it as a licence fee. All the policies regarding 3g spectrum allocation wreaked havoc on the telecom industry, BSNL drowned in debt not because of being a PSU but because of incompetent governments and its policies like most other private telecom companies.\\n* BSNL management didn't live in a vacuum, they perfectly knew 4g was coming and they were not slow or incompetent they were sabotaged internally to act like this.\\n* It's not just Modi, both the BJP and Congress are complicit\\n\\n[https://www.ndtv.com/business/centre-refers-bsnl-4g-spectrum-to-telecom-regulator-report-2008974](https://www.ndtv.com/business/centre-refers-bsnl-4g-spectrum-to-telecom-regulator-report-2008974)\\n\\n[https://www.livemint.com/Politics/jgMgwmlvLCrOPrsnLNnpzJ/BSNL-MTNL-asked-to-pay-Rs16751-cr-for-3G-spectrum.html](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/jgMgwmlvLCrOPrsnLNnpzJ/BSNL-MTNL-asked-to-pay-Rs16751-cr-for-3G-spectrum.html)\\n\\n[https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/bsnl-gives-missed-calls-to-its-employees/story/327619.html](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/bsnl-gives-missed-calls-to-its-employees/story/327619.html)\", 'As we step into December, we all like to start planning for next year.

Another instance of this is how the Gandhi Family disrespected Narasimha Rao, India's most progressive leader. A man who was able to liberalize the Indian economy and initiate many reforms within the Government. The Gandhi Family did not even allow Rao to have his funeral in Delhi and moved him back to Hyderabad.\\n\\nEven as we witness AAP, which seems to be a Congress Party without the Gandhi family, it seems to be much more progressive and eager to change than Congress.\\n\\nSo as a non-Indian, I am curious, do you believe the Gandhi family is suppressing the Left of India, as it silences more progressive reforms and legislation, in favor of status quo?\", '', '', '', '', '**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\\\\*\\\\*.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \\\\- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :\\n\\n1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**\\n2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.\\n3. **Putting in a process of \"Hands On\" education and not  \"Hands free\" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **\"Hands On\"** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **\"PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS\" , \" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**\"  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via \"Interested people\". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying \"HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE\" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.\\n\\n**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be \"leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways\" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of \"PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT\". The push for higher fees with minimal \"restraint\" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both \"Sociologically and systematically\".**\\n\\nA total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSources used :\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1.

Blue Star, 1992, bofors, Gujarat 2002, 2g etc. \\n\\nThanks!', '', \"As the Triple Talaq Bill is on the verge of becoming an actual law, let's take a look at what triple talaq is, what it is not and what really is at the heart of the whole debate. \\n\\nTriple Talaq is something that Islam itself traditionally frowns upon. Scholars have warned against it since time immemorial and it's generally strongly disliked. Its sole purpose was to serve as a remedy for the *really* troubled marriages and some historians believe that it was originally granted by the Prophet as a means for the 'women' who were married to the most despicable men so that they'd escape that relationship as soon as possible. But, as often tends to happen with most well-intentioned laws, people managed to find the loopholes and favored the 'letter' of the law over the 'spirit' of the law. And as such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq, but more on that towards the end.\\n\\nSpeaking of laws and women, Islam is the first religion in history to have given women 'rights': social rights, ownership rights, inheritance rights, marriage rights, the right to initiate divorce, the right to remarry, the right to be a witness and give testimony in matters requiring the same, the right to do business (the Prophet's first wife, Khadijah, was a wealthy merchant herself), the right to fight in battle and many many more. Fourteen HUNDRED years ago. \\n\\nBut, over time, some Muslims twisted the teachings of Islam to suit their own purpose, misused and downright *violated* the very laws of Islam protecting the sanctity of women's rights.. And, over time, it also became okay for the rest of the world to somehow always find a way to judge the 'entirety' of the Muslim community and religion based on the examples set by these worst of Muslims, who are completely unrepresentative of both Islam and most Muslims. \\n\\nAnyway, before I digress, coming back to divorce.. So, more than 1400 years ago, Muslim women were granted the right to initiate divorce through the legal sharia process referred to as *'khula'*. (This when women around the world were either burned at the stake for wanting rights or had to promise to be married to the same man for seven lives or had to throw themselves into the pyre with him when he died.)\\n\\nThis is what the normal, the more 'preferred' mode of talaq (divorce) looks like: It's supposed to be done in three stages, over a period equaling roughly three months, and only after the grounds for it have been firmly established (infidelity, adultery, betrayal, loss of affection, etc). Even this 'normal' form of divorce is only meant to be the 'last resort' when nothing seems to have worked to save the marriage. The first month, provided the grounds for divorce are not major (infidelity and/or adultery) and if there is the slightest hope for reconciliation, both the spouses are encouraged to find common ground and rethink their stance, the second month, once again, is time for reflection and possible reconciliation, and only at the end of the third month, when *all* attempts at reconciliation have clearly failed, is the divorce deemed to be finalized and can the spouses part ways.\\n\\nAnyway, THAT is the 'normal' approach of going about divorce in Islam. And surprise surprise, THAT is how most Muslims actually go about getting a divorce. Most Muslims, too, generally hate the idea of triple talaq. Remember, it's *supposed* to be an absolute last-resort measure, *if that*. Here's a report based on a survey which found that of all the divorce cases amongst Muslims, a mere '0.3' percent were identified as those performed through triple talaq. Less than 1 percent. \\n\\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unimportance-of-triple-talaq-supreme-court-muslim-law-4678304/\\n\\nYes, 0.3 percent. THAT is how low the incidence of triple talaq really is. Let me just say it once again so it really sinks in. ZERO POINT THREE percent. \\n\\nBut, how many of you knew that? Or rather, how many of you were led to believe that 'most' of the divorces among Muslims happen the triple talaq way? Or that it's so prevalent among Muslims that 'millions' of Muslim women are simply abandoned by their husbands within seconds? Or that it's because Islam itself encourages it? Or that it's because women simply have no rights in Islam to begin with? \\n\\nMany, if not everyone. \\n\\nThat brings us now to the second, the hidden yet the more important part of this discussion: the 'politics, propaganda and Islamophobia' aspect of it. \\n\\nIf you could time-travel to today's India from ten years before, odds are you'd find it barely recognizable. 2019 was supposed to be the year when we were just a year away from the watershed moment we dreamed of that would forever change our nation's destiny. We were going to be a developed, happy, prosperous nation, the vision of APJ Abdul Kalam come to life. \\n\\nBut, it's safe to say that that dream is much farther from being a reality *today* than it was ten years ago. And however unrealistic or unattainable that dream may have been to begin with, I am sure nobody in their wildest dreams ever imagined an India where a 'terrorist' would be elected to the parliament and become a 'lawmaker' in 2019.\\n\\nA deeply radicalized, bigoted and easily manipulated religious majority has set the country back by many many years, if not decades. Such is the level of toxic propaganda and such is the intolerance of the truth that nothing and absolutely nothing seems to have the potential to stem the flow of this madness anytime soon. \\n\\nAnd it is in this backdrop that it became possible for a man who abandoned his mother, abandoned his wife decades ago and presided over riots that saw hundreds of women get brutally killed and thousands get raped, to rise to be the 'messiah' for Muslim women and their rights and for everyone else to buy into this whole charade. \\n\\nAnd this allowed everyone to believe that the 'logical' solution to correct the injustice of triple talaq was to 'jail' the man for three years based on a report filed by almost anyone, keep the woman on a measly welfare fund for the same duration, keep her children far away from their father and, thus, eventually, to 'save' the marriage. \\n\\nIf you still think that the triple talaq bill, in its present manifestation, is anything other than a deeply hateful, vengeful exercise of power through which to punish Muslims for, well, *being* Muslims, you clearly are on the wrong side of history. \\n\\n\\nhttps://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/triple-talaq-bill-a-cannonball-that-can-bring-down-an-entire-household-118010100141_1.htmlTriple\", ' \\n\\nCoal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today\\'s podcast episode, I will be exploring India\\'s coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India\\'s demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India\\'s increasing use of coal on the global environment.\\n\\nCoal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India\\'s rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with \"Goon taxes\" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).\\n\\nA problem just as severe as Coal India\\'s inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India\\'s coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India\\'s population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India\\'s coal reserves. India\\'s iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands. The adivasi populations of the region are consistently at the bottom of these impoverished societies, and see few of the benefits of mining. It has been estimated that mining led development has displaced [lakhs ](http://indr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/B.-Terminski-Mining-Induced-Displacement-and-Resettlement.pdf)of people.

While Naxilte rebellion has lost power over the last 8 years, the underlying roots of the conflict have not been addressed.\\n\\nIndia\\'s coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India. India imported $25 billion of coal in [2018](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c2701%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1), and is projected to become the largest imported of coal in the world in 2019.helping keep mines in West Virginia and Australia open. More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India\\'s electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States. Nevertheless, coal is likely to be king for the foreseeable future. Millions of Indians are [buying ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-in-indias-passenger-vehicle-market)their first cars every year, while India produces vast quantities of carbon [intensive ](https://www.devalt.org/newsletter/jan97/of_1.htm)products such as cement and steel. Most importantly, coal consumption is rising rapidly in India. The International Energy Agency projects coal use in India will [increase ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/iea-china-and-india-to-fuel-further-rise-in-global-coal-demand-in-2018)from 563 to 708 million metric tons, with total coal consumption increasing by more than 3% a year. Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015. India [emitted ](https://www.axios.com/china-india-us-pushed-carbon-emissions-to-record-levels-in-2018-1b1e171a-d46a-49b7-bc4a-7250942a1a7d.html)2.6 billion of the worlds total 15.3 billion . While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India\\'s need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.\\n\\nIndia\\'s coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India\\'s economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.\\n\\nSelected Sources:  \\n[Coal in India Adjusting to Transition](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tongia_and_Gross_2019_Coal_In_India_Adjusting_To_Transition.pdf) , Rahul Tongia, Samantha Gross  \\n[The Coal Mine Mafia of India: A Mirror of Corporate Power](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208), Yugank Goyal  \\nPoverty by Social, Religious & Economic Groups in India and Its Largest States 1993-94 to 2011-12 , Arvind Panagiriya  \\n[Targets of violence: evidence from India’s Naxalite conflict](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01202689/document) , Oliver Vanden Eyden  \\n[Carbon dioxide emissions from coal based power generation in India](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44016368/Carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_based20160322-12205-1ad56yc.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1557731198&Signature=Q1AsvfQ0OaJnBpYDRsFAbauVQDY%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCarbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_based.pdf) , Shiv Pratap Raghuvanshi \\\\*, Avinash Chandra, Ashok Kumar Raghav\\n\\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\\n\\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India-Coal.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India-Coal.mp3)', 'I collected news reports and articles about Aadhar to serve as a reminder of data leaks and other incidents relating to it.

What is the basis for this comment?\\n\\n>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.\\n\\n>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.\\n\\n>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.\\n\\nYou’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.\\n\\n>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States\\n\\n>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.\\n\\n>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.\\n\\n>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.\\n\\n>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.\\n\\nWhy didn’t States raise the issue?\\n\\n>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.\\n\\n>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.\\n\\n>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.\\n\\nAren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…\\n\\n>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.\\n\\n>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.\\n\\n>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.\\n\\n>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.\\n\\n>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.\\n\\n>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used\\n\\n>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.\\n\\nSo the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?\\n\\n>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.\\n\\n>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.\\n\\nYou mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?\\n\\n>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.\\n\\nIs it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?\\n\\n>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.\\n\\nThere is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?\\n\\n>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.\\n\\n>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.\\n\\n>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.\\n\\n>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.\\n\\nWhat’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?\\n\\n>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?\\n\\n>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.\\n\\nIsn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?\\n\\n>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.\\n\\nCan this be replicated in other areas?\\n\\n>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.\\n\\n>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.\\n\\nIs that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?\\n\\n>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.\\n\\n>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.\\n\\n>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.\\n\\nPleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.\\n\\n>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.\\n\\n>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.\\n\\nOn the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?\\n\\n>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.\\n\\n>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.\\n\\n>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.\\n\\nCess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?\\n\\n>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.\\n\\nIsnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...\\n\\n>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.\\n\\nYou have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?\\n\\n>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.\\n\\n>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.\\n\\n>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.\\n\\nHow much is this because of a strong leader at the top?\\n\\n>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.\\n\\nIn 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?\\n\\n>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.\\n\\n[The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/yv-reddy-interview/article26489119.ece)', \"Went to buy pc components and my God, prices were high.

After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.\\n\\nAs a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!\\n\\nHow does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2\\xa0The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.\\n\\nAlthough the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3\\n\\nThis changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4\\xa0Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5\\n\\nBut economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.\\n\\nI believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7\\n\\nI shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?\\n\\nLet's begin with the Mughals\\n\\nIndia's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8\\xa0During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9\\xa0India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10\\n\\nIn 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11\\n\\nIt took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12\\xa0What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.\\n\\nIndia was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century\\n\\nIndia was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13\\xa0It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?\\n\\nDespite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14\\xa0and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15\\n\\nThere is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16\\xa0There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”\\n\\nDid the British Raj impoverish India?\\n\\nIndia's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.\\n\\nNationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17\\n\\nBritain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18\\n\\nIn recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19\\n\\nThey also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20\\xa0If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.\\n\\nIndia begins to re-industrize\\n\\nIndian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.”\\xa022\\xa0The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.\\n\\nBy Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).\\n\\nWhy didn't an industrial revolution occur?\\n\\nOne of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.\\n\\nAmiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24\\xa0If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25\\xa0An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26\\xa0But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.\\n\\nUnlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.\\n\\nWhat is the verdict on British rule?\\n\\nDid the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.\\n\\nOdd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27\\xa0Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28\\n\\nAlthough Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.\\n\\nIndependence and 'License Raj'\\n\\nAfter Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?\\n\\nI think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.\\n\\nNehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.\\n\\nEven more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.\\n\\nLarge business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29\\n\\nThe system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.\\n\\nAlthough it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30\\n\\n“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32\\xa0It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.\\n\\nIndia after the Reforms\\n\\nAlthough there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33\\n\\nIndians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.\\n\\nThere has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.\\n\\nThe world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.\\n\\nSome lessons\\n\\nNeoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.\\n\\nBut this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.\\n\\nAfter Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.\\n\\nIndia embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.\\n\\nIndia's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.\\n\\nSince politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.\\n\\nBut India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.\\n\\nWill capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.\\n\\nThe curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.\\n\\nDoes culture matter?\\n\\nCultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34\\n\\nDeepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35\\xa0David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36\\n\\nWhile institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.\\n\\nThus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37\\xa0It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.\\n\\nWhen seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.\\n\\nI find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.\\n\\nOur continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.\\n\\n\\n\", '', \"Hello guys,\\n\\nI am looking for some Indian websites or youtube channels to learn more about finance,economy,markets and money in general.

This is the indicator of Gross Fixed Capital Formation in infrastructure. The NDA as well know focussed a lot on infrastructure, roads and the highway network being chief amongst these. The NDA added more roads in 5 years than 30 years of other governments combined. Without the govt massively investing in actual infrastructure, job creation and economic growth is going to be difficult to manage.\\n\\nThis is not new either (the UPA mismanagement), Indira Gandhi did pretty much the same thing. She created an import fueled bubble of illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation. *Windows of Opportunity: Memoirs of an Economic Adviser by Krishnaswamy* goes into detail into how Indira almost wrecked the national economy by recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring to 75% in the late 60\\'s. Indira also established the trend of a socialistic economy (not her father, who piloted a Mixed economy) by ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal to banking to wheat and imposing draconian restrictions on the private sector. Indira ALSO failed to focus on infrastructure, and during her first regime, cut down on investment in infrastructure.\\n\\nAfter Nehru who did very well to guide the Indian economy given his set of challenges, every succeeding Gandhi dynast has been an absolute disaster for the national economy. \\n\\nThe problem is, the Gandhi / Congress way has now caught on and almost every major party follows the same dead approach of populsim, throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics.\\n\\n**Subjective opinion**- In BJP I see a party that is serious about building up infrastructure, that is serious about creating jobs, that while populist, marries this populism with a sense of pragmatism. It is arguably the only party right now that sees merit in manufacturing as being the workhorse of the Indian economy. I see how the BJP method has worked (relative to India of course) in places like Chatisgarh, MP, Gujarat, Goa. Yes, it has failed in Karnataka, yet it has the resilience to learn and apply lessons and not just throw up some dynast scion to continue the same tired old politics.\\n\\nSloganeering, empty tokenism and sops all won\\'t work without some hard reforms, and this is something the BJP has an established track record in and this is why I support the BJP.\\n\\nSource for the data is [The planning commission](http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/index.php?data=datatab)\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit - I seriously (cross my heart and hope to die, pinky swear level) don\\'t care about points, and a self post doesn\\'t even give me any points, but 30 seconds after I posted this, I was at -1.

BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.\\n\\nWe have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.\\n\\nI am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'\\n\\nWhile all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.\\n\\nAll these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!\\n\\nI do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.\\n\\nA rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.\\n\\nSo yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.\\n\\nI am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.\\n\\nLastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)\", 'It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.\\n\\nOne of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed at the edges and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.\\n\\nWe have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.\\n\\nCulturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.\\n\\nSocially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.\\n\\nThe Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.\\n\\nAnd so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?\\n\\nEveryone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?\\n\\nNehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.\\n\\nWhen I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.\\n\\nOne worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.\\n\\nA young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.\\n\\nThe real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation.  The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.\\n\\nOne of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because – “ It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you, than to convince 1 billion illiterate people, never mind that they are your own people.”. There is a word to describe such people. It is ‘mercenary’. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?\\n\\nIt is easier to convince three hundred million literates to vote for you. It is far more difficult for these people to convince the one billion Indians who are their countrymen to vote for them because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mothertongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.\\n\\n**TL;DR - Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.**', '', '', '', '**Internet shutdowns are a growing national menace**\\n\\nThe internet continues to be shut down in different parts of India with increasing frequency.

If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  \\n  \\n**[NP] - Non-political**  \\n  \\nThese are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  \\n \\nThis is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  \\n  \\n**[R] - Reddiquette**  \\n  \\nWhen this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    \\n  \\nJokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.\\n  \\nThis can be used for both political and non-political topics.  \\n  \\n**[ASK] - AskIndia**  \\n  \\nThese are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  \\n  \\nIf the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  \\n  \\n**Science & Technology** \\n\\nThis flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   \\n \\nIf Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  \\nIf the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  \\n\\n**Policy & Economy**\\n  \\nThese flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  \\n\\n**Business & Finance**  \\n\\nThese flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  \\n  \\n**Entertainment** \\n\\nEntertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  \\n  \\nThis flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   \\n \\n**Sports and Food** \\n\\nSports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  \\n\\n**AMA**\\n  \\nAMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team.

Does no math.\\n\\n**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**\\n\\nA look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here\\'s a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. \\n\\nWhile Japan\\'s Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India\\'s inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).\\n\\nThe author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India\\'s inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan\\'s inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.\\n\\n>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.\\n\\nHas the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. \\n\\n###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here\\'s the actual math:\\n\\nWe are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.\\n\\nSince the author is concerned with exchange rates, that\\'s JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. \\n\\n^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)\\n\\nOver 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That\\'s *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.\\n\\nSo effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**\\n\\n###Now here\\'s where the author\\'s argument (and lack of math) is turned on its\\' head:\\n\\nAssuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren\\'t losing anything but time. That\\'s great for them.\\n\\nBut seeing how India\\'s inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn\\'t translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. \\n\\n###Still don\\'t get it? Okay try this: \\n\\nHere\\'s a real-life example using real data from the past:\\n\\n* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)\\n* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).\\n\\nLet\\'s forget the \\'trillions\\' for simplicity.\\n\\nSay your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.\\n\\nNow, back in Grandpa\\'s day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year\\'s salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).\\n\\nMeanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its\\' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.\\n\\nSo your Grandpa paid off a month\\'s rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that\\'s why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.\\n\\nNow obviously, if the author is right, and Japan\\'s inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won\\'t lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn\\'t go absolutely berserk. \\n\\n###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today\\'s terms). \\n\\n^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)\\n\\nThis is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. \\n\\nPut another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that\\'s impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our \\'loan\\' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. \\n\\nIf you\\'re using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)\\n\\nSo... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it\\'s effectively free. \\n\\nNow, mind you, we aren\\'t getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its\\' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.\\n\\nYes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa\\'s ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don\\'t want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big \\'loan\\'.\\n\\nThis, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation.

Let\\'s assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.\\n\\nThe article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that\\'s 44,000 people per day), but that it\\'ll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn\\'t something that can increase exponentially, we\\'ll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.\\n\\n\\n    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years\\n    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years\\n    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.\\n\\nBasically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).\\n\\nSo averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That\\'s 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. \\n\\n    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.\\n\\n1,471,680,000 passengers total: that\\'s **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? \\n\\n###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. \\n\\nLet\\'s assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. \\n\\n[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. \\n\\nThat leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. \\n\\n**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**\\n\\n###Wait, what?! \\n\\n*You\\'re telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* \\n\\nI dunno!

With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in \"operational costs\" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.\\n\\nWho in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea?

But here are my observations so far. These are just my opinion and experiences and may not represent the whole situation accurately\\n\\n* On Nov 8^th I was pretty happy that the government did it, as I was naive to the whole economy thing I thought it was an ingenious idea to get rid of all the black money\\n\\n* I was still resistant after a week when 30+ uncles started complaining (note: these were the same uncles & aunties that praised Modi up and down on 9/11 and so did I as a matter of fact )\\n\\n* Even after 3 weeks i wasn't affected as i was able to withdraw 2000 and 2500 on different occasions quite easily (funny stories btw, first time i walked in to a random ATM where i saw a bunch of people doing something to the ATM machine, i just stood in front of the door and was watching what they were doing, after couple of minutes they looked at me and made a gesture to come in, and when i went the guy in Khaki(idk if he was police) told me i can draw cash now, I proceeded and gave the amount as 400, the Gurkha looked at me weirdly and said the limit was 2000, I couldn't process at the moment what he was saying and thought may be only 2000's notes were there. So i reentered the amount as 2000 and drew a stack of 20 100s! as i turned back i saw a huge ass mob outside the ATM! with people still running towards it as i was heading out of the area! )\\n\\n* But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, **This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!**\\n\\n* Think about it. Most of the taxes come from the working middle class people in our country. Now from this move a bunch of poor people have been included to the tax roster, let's be honest, the rich have already been avoiding taxes very intelligently and they wouldn't shell out a paisa no matter how the rules get stricter. Thanks to all the private CA guys who never  made it.\\n\\n* Then modi announced about releasing records of transactions from his party members **After** 8/11. **BUT** , wouldn't they have already took measures Before 8/11... if we want to be honest here, we should check on ALL politician transactions at least five years prior to this.\\n\\n* What about black money in the form of foreign currencies? To the uninformed people, Switzerland is NOT the only tax haven in the world, so who ever did have swiss accounts, would've probably switched to somewhere else. So we're not getting that money either.\\n\\n* All this whole fiasco did was, bringing bunch of poor people in to Tax radar, But they earn so less, we can't actually tax them.\\n\\n* But i do have a proposal though, we can efficiently use the tax money and skyrocket india's progress, but the people of india needs to involve with the policy making at the root level like people of denmark and some other baltic states do. All we have to do is to have a system where the government still collects taxes but is unable to use the money without the tax payers approval and should give them details for every paisa used.\\n\\n* people should be given the power of choosing where their tax money is invested into, A nice swimming pool for a minister's residence?: Not gonna give my money.  A public toilet and a public high rise parking lot?: Shut up and take our money.\\n\\n* But how would we the ^^busy people keep involved in all these process? Well, just like wester countries have Jury duties , india should have a taxer duty, where a group of people are selected from the people investing in a project and are sent to negotiate the process, these people should be non-government citizens and nobody gets to go twice from the same group or similar duration. During that period the taxers should be given paid leaves from their jobs and shouldn't be deducted from their privileged accounts.\\n\\n* I'm tired now and can't type anymore, but this is my argument. **demonetization was done to bring people under tax watch, but the people we needed in tax watch evaded it any way, this whole scenario was masqueraded as a fight against corruption, which won't stop, but we can smarten up now and demand accountability for our tax money before it gets devoured by our ridiculous politicians and the bureaucracy, because, INDIA!**\\n\\npeace \", 'I was reading an article, and it piqued my curiosity. \\n\\nWhat role will Govt play, if private sector has a free run?', \"I know Reddit's distaste for clicking on links so I also put the article in plain text here below.

While their performance in Telangana and Mizoram was disappointing, it will take heart from its wins in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. \\n\\nFor a party which was in disarray until a year and half ago with no clear sense of direction from the party high command, the Congress has slowly staggered back onto its feet to fight the Modi and Shah duo. With a seemingly reinvigorated Rahul Gandhi at the helm, they have taken the fight to the BJP in Modi’s own bastion-Gujarat, cobbled together an alliance in Karnataka and now snatched Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh back from the BJP. \\n\\nWhile the party is trying hard to capitalise on the anger of the masses against the Central government’s policies and decisions, the Congress still has a lot of work to do on the ground level if it seriously wants to come back to power in 2019. While the results might show Congress winning in three states, there is a very distinct and real possibility that voters were fed up with their state BJP governments due to anti-incumbency and they are still going to vote for Modi to become the PM again in 2019.The Congress’s performance in Rajasthan is also considered to be relatively disappointing with chaotic seat distribution, infighting and rebel Congress leaders costing the party another 15 odd seats.\\n\\n**What next for the BJP?**\\n\\nWhile the results aren’t going to make BJP workers too happy, the BJP still remains in pole position to come back to power in 2019. With the so called ‘Third Front’ still nowhere near fruition and the Congress’s efforts to pitch RaGa against NaMo not exactly gathering steam with other opposition parties means that Modi continues to be the most popular political leader in India currently. The extradition of Christian Michel related to the Agusta Westland scam and the recent court order allowing the extradition of Vijay Mallya from the UK also serve as a timely boost to the BJP’s anti-corruption rhetoric, which was on a slippery slope after the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi sagas. The BJP has also made no effort to hide its Hindutva agenda, starting with the renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. BJP led state governments in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also cleared the way for the building of gigantic statues of Lord Shiva and Rama respectively and this Hindutva pitch will only get more brazen in the lead-up to 2019.\\n\\nWhile the BJP might be smug about its chances in 2019, it has to keep an eye on the grumbling middle class and farmers-both unhappy with poll promises not being kept. The agrarian distress and lack of job creation have taken the shine off Modi’s ‘booming economy’ pitch and the BJP will be anxious to ensure it doesn’t snowball further. Furthermore, the central government’s rift with the RBI and frequent clash-ins with the Supreme Court have created the image of an overzealous central government keen to take control of all independent central agencies. \\n\\n**Will KCR lead for the formation of a Third Front?**\\n\\nTRS’s emphatic victory in the state of Telangana and K Chandrashekar Rao’s victory speech might mean the resurgence in the chances for the formation of a Third Front consisting of other regional satraps including Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati. The Third Front has traditionally been a cluster of regional parties which choose to neither align with the Congress or the BJP. However, the Third Front, which has always been talked of as an alternative to India’s two-party stronghold, has never managed to give a serious fight to the Congress or the BJP in recent history. The only times the Third Front or Federal Front provided a serious threat to the Congress or BJP was in between 1996 and 1998 when it staked power at the Centre twice under H.D. Deve Gowda. Quite predictably, the government collapsed soon after due to infighting and horse-trading of MPs. \\n\\nIt will be interesting to see if a Third Front comes into existence in time for 2019 and more interestingly, if they can prevent making the mistakes that they have committed in the past and become a force to reckon with.\\n\\n**Controversy about EVMs**\\n\\nAdding further fuel to the EVM tampering controversy, it was reported this week by multiple news sources that CCTV malfunctions occurred in the strongrooms where the EVMs were stored. Technical snags in CCTV systems installed inside the storage rooms came from Vidisha, Mandla and Bhopal. In Vidisha, it is reported that CCTV cameras went blank for 15 minutes while the one in Mandla went blank for 2 hours. Tough questions must be asked of the Election Commission as to how such a situation was allowed to develop in the first place and what it plans to do to ensure the electoral system isn’t compromised.\", '_\"The Tejas is an old design. It has taken 32 long years to develop! And despite being in development for so long, it isn\\'t truly indigenous. Its heart, the engine, is of foreign origin. So are its weapons and some avionics. Furthermore, it is so deficient in its performance, that the Indian Air Force (IAF) wants Rafales/Su-30MKIs/F-16s instead.\"_\\n\\nEvery time the Tejas achieves some important milestone, these criticisms are repeated ad nauseum, in the popular media, on Twitter, on internet forums, and at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya. It\\'s infuriating to see an effort of this magnitude, one that has produced [many successes](http://www.ibnlive.com/blogs/india/saurav-jha/the-radiance-of-tejas-a-bright-prospect-for-make-in-india-10879-748651.html), being panned time and again. So I\\'ve taken the liberty to put together this handy-dandy LCA Tejas mythbusting guide to counter them.\\n\\nAnd without wasting your time any further, I\\'ll jump right in.\\n\\n**False Argument 1: The Tejas is \"late\". It has been under development for 32 years!**\\n\\nThe figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest. See [this list of milestones](http://www.tejas.gov.in/history/milestones.html) for reference.\\n\\nFollowing several years of delay in the development process—delays that can at least partly be traced back to overly optimistic R&D timeline projections, scope creep, and [US sanctions on India](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-31/news/39655783_1_drdo-chief-v-k-saraswat-lca-project) following the 1998 nuclear tests—the Tejas had its first flight in 2001. From then, the project proceeded at a pace that is not too different that of comparable fighter aircraft development programmes worldwide. It is slated to achieve final operational clearance (FOC), the stage at which an aircraft is considered fully ready for squadron service, in early 2017; fifteen years from the date of the first flight. At this time, the it is expected to be ready to carry out multiple functions: beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air combat, short-range dogfighting, and precision ground attack with a variety of guided and unguided weaponry.\\n\\nThat compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The first technology demonstrator of what would later be called the Typhoon first flew [in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Eurofighter_Typhoon). The definitive version with an AESA radar is [still not in service today](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/euroradar-nears-flight-test-phase-for-captor-e-on-ty-416564/), 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn\\'t available [until 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm). Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight. \\n\\nThe Tejas is about to FOC with all of these capabilities in late 2016. The fact that ADA managed to achieve similar or better timelines with the Tejas after its first flight, that too without the benefit of half a century of experience in building advanced fighters or the industrial ecosystem that enables such high-technology to proceed swiftly, is an achievement that is not given enough credit.\\n\\n**False Argument 2: Because of the inordinate delays in development, the Tejas is now deficient.**\\n\\nJust because the development was delayed doesn\\'t mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities throughout the design and development phase. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify subsystems after every modification. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:\\n\\n* Open avionics architecture.\\n* Precision bombing capabilities.\\n* Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).\\n* Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.\\n* Inflight refueling\\n* More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)\\n\\nWith these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. \\n\\n**False Argument 3: The LCA falls short on several performance parameters like empty weight, range, turn rates, etc. The IAF has allowed 53 concessions/permanent waivers in the design.**\\n\\nLike the 32-year delay, this too is a scary looking quote that paints a false picture of how fighter aircraft programmes work.\\n\\nFirst off, it is important to remember that the Tejas can carry out most of the tasks intended of it quite competently. It can fight other aircraft at beyond visual range (when equipped with an AESA radar and Derby/Derby-ER missiles, it could end up becoming _the most capable_ BVR platform in IAF service). The addition of an Israeli helmet-mounted sight coupled to missiles whose seekers have a wide field of view (R-73 and Python IV/V) make it a fearsome dogfighter and compensate for minuscule shortfalls in aerodynamic performance. It can drop laser-guided bombs on ground targets with great precision. It is also very easy to fly. [In the words of the IAF](http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/air-force-drdo-pleased-with-tejas-performance-at-bahrain-116022200321_1.html), the fighter’s \"control harmony is comparable to the best in the world… The intuitive cockpit layout and highly reliable life support systems provide for comfort as well as excellent situational awareness.\" There are many such triumphs; too many, in fact, to recount here.\\n\\nSecondly, _every_ fighter project concludes with specifications that aren\\'t met, or a few deficiencies in performance. It’s never that big of a roadblock to induction in service. And all said and done, 53 is a very small number as far as design concessions go; a pretty small portion of the entire range of capabilities. Even simpler aircraft (like the [C-17]( http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732)) enter service with more deficiencies. These are either compensated with using improvements in other areas to offset performance shortfalls, or accepted in the interest of availability for combat. \\n\\nAgain, I shall go back to the Eurofighter Typhoon to illustrate my point. Remember I mentioned that it first flew in 1986? Twenty-two years later, it [couldn\\'t independently drop a laser-guided bomb](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/01/eurofighter_austere_air_to_ground_what_joy/) on a target with any precision. Basic BVR combat capability was not available until Tranche 2 models were procured [in 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm), 14 years after the first flight. Even in close air combat, its capabilities were decidedly limited. The helmet mounted sight (HMS)—a system that allows the pilot to cue weapons onto an enemy aircraft by simply turning his head and offers a quantum jump in dogfighting capabilities—did not enter service [until 2010](https://www.eurofighter.com/about-us).\\n\\nThe F-35 was hobbled by similar issues (and terrible program management) [for several years](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/joint-strike-fighter-lockheed-martin). It didn\\'t begin to turn a corner until 2012 or so, after which it began rapidly demonstrating some of the capabilities that were expected of it.\\n\\nThe companies running these projects were aero giants with decades of experience behind them. How then does one expect the ADA, which has never developed a fighter in its entire existence, to deliver a more capable product while experiencing fewer failures? \\n\\nThirdly, the IAF itself works with deficient designs all the time. The Gnat and Su-7, both hobbled by short ranges and limited payloads, were procured in large numbers. The MiG-21, when initially inducted, was underwhelming. Its range was limited and its missiles didn\\'t work. The Bison is still riddled with issues. The Jaguar had a deficient nav-attack suite. It was practically useless in the long range strike role until the IAF and HAL developed and implemented the [DARIN upgrades](https://tkstales.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/the-darin-story/). The MiG-27\\'s navigation system [never performed satisfactorily](http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/07/special-report-story-of-indias-mig-27.html), and its reliability was terrible. But none of this troubled the IAF. Why then is the LCA failing to achieve a handful design parameters something to raise a huge hue and cry about?\\n\\n\\n**False Argument 4(a): The LCA isn\\'t really indigenous. Many of its subsystems are of foreign origin.**\\n\\nBut many more of its critical subsystems are of Indian origin too! The first one that comes to mind is the carbon-fibre composite airframe. It is a very high-end product that reduces weight (thus permitting the carriage of a substantial external payload), aids maintenance, brings down manufacturing time, and so on. The fact that some of the technology involved in its manufacture has been exported to Airbus is a testament to its success.\\n\\nAnother example is the digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, developed from scratch by ADA scientists in India after their work, notes, and equipment was impounded by Lockheed Martin in 1998. No country on earth, not one, has developed such a complex system and gotten it to work perfectly on the first try. It works so well that when it was first tested on an F-16XL in the US (this was before the nuclear tests), it improved the test-bed\\'s handling qualities in several flight regimes. There is a reason the Tejas\\' test pilots call the aircraft to fly.\\n\\nThere are many other examples. The avionics. The mission computers. The navigation equipment, displays, and human-machine interface. The EW systems. This stuff isn\\'t trivial by any yardstick.\\n\\nNow coming to the foreign components aboard the aircraft. With the exception of the Americans, and to an extent the Russians, _every_ country has used foreign subsystems extensively in its aircraft designs. The [Gripen](http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?model=JAS_39_Gripen) has an American engine, a British airframe design, Swiss carbon-fibre, an Italian radar, an American flight control system, a cockpit with critical components purchased from Britain, and so on. This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India\\'s and extensive experience developing cold-war fighters such as the Draken and Gripen. The Rafale and Typhoon both use American ejection seats. Their flight control system uses actuators from Moog, an American company. The Russians were buying [Damocles pods](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/russian-fighters-to-use-thales-damocles-targeting-pods-220747/) for the Su-35s before the French stopped military exports after they invaded Crimea. Nearly every Chinese fighter in service today uses a Russian engine, a Russian ejection seat, and a slew of Russian weaponry. If these aircraft all qualify as \"indigenous\", then surely the Tejas does too?\\n\\nThe choice that Indian design agencies faced was quite stark: should they have tried to build every little component in-house, thus reinventing the wheel at every step? Or used technologies/sub-systems available easily in the market in the initial stages and then made an attempt to indigenise over the life-cycle of the product? It\\'s obvious that the latter was the more sensible path to take.\\n\\nIn the final analysis, the Tejas is an aircraft that has been designed by Indians in India, and is tailored to Indian requirements. If that doesn\\'t make it indigenous, I don\\'t know what does.\\n\\t\\n\\n**False Argument 4(b): Okay, I get that. But the aircraft\\'s very heart, its engine, is fully imported! Surely it\\'s an utter failure on that front?**\\n\\nYes and no. It has had a very protracted development cycle, and for good reason. A jet engine is arguably represents the pinnacle of modern technology, making it the most challenging system in the world to develop from scratch. It has to produce ungodly amounts of power for its size and operate at the very edge of what physics allows. The GE F404—which ended up replacing the Kaveri on the LCA—weighs just a shade over 1000 kg and develops close to 80 kN of wet thrust. Assuming that it propels the LCA to Mach 0.9 at sea level (1,100 km/h), it\\'s developing about 24,400 kW or 32,700 hp. That\\'s 32 hp per kg. In contrast, a Formula-1 car engine generates \"only\" 8 or 9 hp per kg, and it\\'s about as far as one can get with piston engines.\\n\\nWhat does it take to generate so much power? One needs critical components like turbine blade assemblies that see inlet temperatures of 1,400°C or so while being subject to extreme forces. A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures tells me that a single high pressure turbine blade weighing 50 gm, and rotating at 16,000 RPM at the end of a 500 mm diameter disk, will be subject to a centrifugal force of about 3,500 kgf. Imagine two Honda Civics hanging off a tiny blade that is about as large as two of your fingers held together. There is a transverse load component as well; the 80 kN of thrust is distributed over the turbine blades. \\n\\nIn order to sustain such loads, exotic materials and precision manufacturing techniques are required. Steel melts at about 1400°C, and starts rapidly losing strength at less than 500°C, so it\\'s obviously not an option. Modern engines instead use nickel-based superalloys. Moreover, the material can\\'t simply be cast or forged or machined into shape. The blade has to be produced via directional solidification or grown out of a single crystal in what looks more like a lab than a production shop. The shape, too, is very intricate. There are internal channels that route cold air taken from the compressor to the surface of the blade to keep it cool.\\n\\nThe fan, compressor, combustor, gearbox assemblies, bearings ... they\\'re just as complex. And they all have to be precision manufactured to ensure that microscopic imbalances don\\'t end up leading to excessive vibrations that could end up destroying the engine and the aircraft while in flight. Then there are requirements like safety, fuel efficiency, minimum total technical life, and reliability that add multiple layers of complexity to the design.\\n\\nNow imagine the magnitude of effort required to develop something like this, with practically zero infrastructure and very little in terms of  a pre-existing knowledge base. And with skinflint bureaucrats refusing to approve requests for funding, test equipment, or manufacturing tools without documentation being submitted in triplicate and subject to audit after audit.\\n\\nNow let us talk costs. The GTRE spent [Rs. 2,000 crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rs-2101-crore-spent-on-development-of-indigenous-kaveri-engine-heres-why-theres-been-a-delay/articleshow/48282481.cms), or approximately $640 million in equivalent US dollars (with all the exchange rate and inflation variations that happened between 1989 and now taken into account), on developing the Kaveri. This seems like a lot, until you see that advanced nations spend billions on such programmes, and they almost never develop clean-sheet designs. They are always building on existing knowledge and existing designs. \\n\\n[Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE says](http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-on-transforming-ge-2015-12), \"If you could make something with 60 people in a garage, GE shouldn\\'t be doing it. But if you make a jet engine, there\\'s only like one and a half people in the world that can make a jet engine. And we are really good at that. If you want to compete with that, you\\'ve got to put yourself on a wayback machine and go back 25 years and invest $1 billion here for 25 years and then _maybe, just maybe_ [emphasis mine], you\\'re going to be able to compete with us.\"\\n\\nThink about that for a second. It requires 25 years. And a billion dollars. And then too, you\\'re more likely to fail than succeed.\\n\\nThe Chinese have been pouring money and espionage resources into their jet engine development efforts (they have budgeted [300 billion yuan](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030)—about 45 billion in today\\'s US dollars—over the next 20 years on engine programs alone), and are still facing [significant hurdles](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030). Why do people feel that India would get significant results by spending just a few thousand crores?\\n\\nIn any case, the Kaveri isn\\'t a complete write off. A naval derivative, the [Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/built-for-air-force-kaveri-engine-chosen-by-navy-109090800089_1.html) may end up powering Indian Navy vessels. It is also under consideration to [power an Indian UAV](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/now-kaveri-engine-to-power-indigenous-uav-115073001650_1.html). \\n\\nThere are civilian spin-offs too. For example, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) [now uses](http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/DRDO_BROCHURE_2015.pdf) the investment casting technology developed by GTRE for manufacturing blades for gas turbines used in power generation.\\n\\n**False Argument 5: In a globalised world, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. The IAF should simply dump it and buy the Gripen/F-16/MiG-35**\\n\\nWhat is true for cell phones or cars isn’t true for military equipment. In the long run, in peace and in war, the IAF would be best served by fielding fighters designed and built in India. That\\'s the only way it will equip itself with a large fleet on a (relatively) small budget. There are other advantages to developing the technology in-house: less dependence on foreign suppliers, leading to increased strategic independence. Creation of a stronger local economy and industrial ecosystem. The freedom to tinker with the design and optimise it to suit local requirements without running afoul of IP agreements with the OEM. Spin-offs in the civilian world. And so on and so forth. And if going indigenous is indeed the way forward, then the IAF will have to live with fielding under-performing/problematic designs at the beginning. It will have to make peace with the fact that aerospace R&D is a slow, painful process that is fraught with risk.\\n\\nThat\\'s how practically everyone else did it. The Chinese did not seek out the latest and greatest toy because their initial designs (Q-5, JH-7, J-8, J-10) failed to match up to what the US, Japan, and India fielded. If the J-10B and J-20 are flying today, it is only because the PLAAF and PLAN flew inferior aircraft for decades while their industrial capabilities matured. As it is, the Tejas program\\'s achievements have been quite impressive: the country has developed a fourth-generation fighter that is as good as the Gripen-C from scratch. It uses more home-grown technology than the Gripen does; including such critical subsystems like the digital FBW, the composite airframe, a large portion of the avionics, etc. Many of these have been applied to the IAF\\'s legacy aircraft as upgrade packages. To throw it all away because of a handful of challenges here and there or because Lockheed or Boeing are offering to transfer their manufacturing lines to India would be incredibly, utterly stupid. If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter.\\n', 'Steve Hanke [recently tweeted](https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/837745899803652096) that \"India\\'s growth is only solid b/c it ignores the adverse effect of #demonetization on the massive informal economy\".\\n\\nHe [followed this up](https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/838125144769884160) with a tweet saying \"Modi\\'s thieving #Demonetization policy has slowed the Indian economy to worst Q growth since 2014.

At the time of writing, this was liked more than a 1000 times and shared more than 180 times on their Facebook Page.\\n\\nDo not trust the mainstream media. Doing your own research and digging up your own numbers will present you with a much better picture of the world.', \"The whole thing came up recently during some discussions I had about why people use the dollar for international trade and what would happen if the major economies of the world just stopped using the Dollar. What is the Impact of BRICS. Why US has so many wars in the middle east and they are supposedly for oil but they never really take over any oil. How US is so rich to have 800 military bases around the world with a defence budget larger than the rest of the world combined. About why countries still hold US dollar reserves when US is in trillions of dollars of debt and being in so much debt, how is US economy still afloat? So I thought of putting it together here for myself and anyone else who may want to learn about this. Now, this is what I have gleaned from my reading on the matter. I am no economist so if anyone wants to correct me on anything, I would be welcome to accept the criticism with reference material substantiating your point.\\n\\n in 1944, all the countries entered into the Bretton Woods Agreement which basically said that all of the world’s currrecies would be backed by the US Dollar and the US dollar would be backed by gold and any country could convert their currency into US dollars and then redeem US gold in exchange for that at the rate of 35 dollars per ounce of gold. Since US had the largest gold reserves at the time (75% of the entire world's gold), everyone agreed. This also allowed US treasury to fix exchange rates of dollar into different currencies and set the interest rates for interbanking transactions etc. However, the multiple wars of the US during the ’60s caused domestic inflation in the US and the value of Dollar to fall. This caused panic in all the countries and they started redeeming gold from US treasury. The US gold fell from 20,000 tonnes to 8100 tonnes very quickly. Thus, in 1971, Nixon closed the gold window i.e. he suspended the ability of any nation to redeem US gold against dollars and took the gold backing off of the US Dollar. While that allowed US to retain its gold reserves, it made the need of the US dollar among other countries non existent. So everyone started to move away from the Dollar. After that, US economy started to spiral and the price of gold became 135 dollars per ounce. On top of that, the Arab world hiked the oil prices. Now, the US desperately needed to stabilize the spiral. So they brokered a deal with the Saudis that the oil producers would not only trade oil in nothing but US Dollars and convince the OPEC (the middle eastern, north African and other oil producing countries) to do the same but also invest their (OPEC’s) oil profits in US treasury by buying US Treasury bonds. This basically means that they (OPEC) are buying out US debt. Not only this, US is printing Dollars against the amount of Foreign investments in the US treasury which is made by Oil producing nations which are their oil profits. So basically, profits from every barrel sold by OPEC make way to the US treasury and become the value against which dollars is printed. Ultimately, more the profits in oil, stronger the dollar and lesser the profits in oil, weaker the dollar. Thus US gets a double benefit out of every barrel of oil in a way. In exchange the US would sell them (Saudis) advance weapons and all the gold they demanded. (So basically weapons and gold sale in exchange for trading oil in dollars props up US dollar. Gold is still propping up US dollar indirectly by forcing the oil producers to trade in dollars). Thus the petrodollar was born. This caused the world to need US dollar again. If you wanted to buy oil, you needed US dollar by either converting your currency or by selling stuff to the US. The latter is more preferred as it is cheaper than exchanging your currency and also grows your economy. So once again, US became the benchmark of international trade since no country can hope to grow its economy without using energy aka oil and you can’t have oil without US dollars. As long as all these countries need oil, US can just print Dollars out of thin air and balance it against oil barrels (as explained above) without actually even owning a single drop of oil. (Other countries need to own the gold that they balance their currency against). US does not need to control oil, they just need to control the currency it is traded in to keep their economy afloat. (more on that later in US foreign policy). Similarly, US bokered a deal with the Latin American countries to not only trade in the US Dollar but also to give precedence to US, EU and Japanese products in trade. So if more and more countries decide to shun the dollar and trade in other currencies, this would eventually cause OPEC to switch as well and Dollar could collapse.\\n\\nHow? Well, US is basically just printing enormous amounts of money out of thin air. This money is being used domestically and to a much larger extent, globally. If international oil trade in dollar stops, people stop needing the dollar and use their own currency. So all the internationally circulating dollars would come back to US. Now that is just too many dollars against very little amount in the treasury and that would cause hyperinflation and economic spiral. However, the logical next step would be to just destroy the excess dollars coming in from abroad and that would keep the country’s economy afloat. While that is okay but remember, what is the dollar being printed against? The foreign investments in the treasury which are the profits from the oil trade in dollars. That would go away as well essentially leaving nothing in the treasury against which the dollar is valued. Hence dollar will literally not be worth the money it is printed on.\\n\\nSecond, since US currency is basically a petrodollar, its power depends on the control of oil. So right now, whoever controls middle east has major power. Today, Saudi Arabia controls Middle East and US controls Saudi Arabia. US-Saudi brotherhood sort of makes it impossible for other countries to have an influence over this. Russia has tried for decades to establish a strong foothold in the middle east but has been unsuccessful. It has also dictated the US foreign policy far the last 5 decades. Like I said, US needs to control not the oil reserves but the currency oil is traded in. Hence all the wars we hear that were for oil, were not actually for oil per se but intimidation tactics against countries that announced that they would no longer accept dollar as a currency in international oil trade. Egs When the Ayatollah of Iran announced their intention to denounce dollars in oil trade and use their own currency instead, US backed Iraq to go to war with Iran and even provided the Weapons of mass destruction to use on Iran that they later used as an excuse to invade Iraq and prosecuted Saddam Hussein for. When Iraq invaded Kuwait ( a major producer of oil) to be able to pay their loans to Kuwait and then later asked for Euro to be used for oil trade rather than Petrodollar, US invaded Iraq. When Gaddafi asked gold based Dinar instead of US dollars for oil trade, US invaded Libya. When Chavez did the same, Us staged a coup in Venezuela. However, starting a non-petro currency would break this link and oil and Middle east would become less relevant for Economic power and only be of interest for energy concerns. It is still important but less so than a economic and geopolitical chessboard of US that it is today. It may actually be a solution to achieving peace in the middle east.\\n\\nHowever, another thing that happens is Middle East controls prices of oil which is tied to the Dollar. Recently, the Middle East (OPEC or basically Saudi Arabia) has decided to drop the international prices for their own economic reasons. Now, the countries that have oil production as a major source of revenue and trade in dollars eg many N African countries, Venezuela have seen their economy completely stabilise and destroyed. These countries are sick of US and Saudi controlling the markets in a way that affects other countries adversely. Hence, for these countries, switching to the international trading system of a gold based currency will cause their economies to stabilise.\\n\\nThe international reserves of EU etc, on the other hand have seen increased holdings by the OPEC countries and have been worried of increasing power of these countries in the international banking system. They would be only to glad to get rid of these holdings.\\n\\nNow, non Dollar currency would cause a fall in the US dollar value. In lieu of that, here is another thing that needs to be considered. A lot of the developing countries have international trade deficits. Now these trade deficits can be in the currency of the country to whom the debt is owed or any other internationally accepted currency eg. the Dollar. If the debt is in dollars, the conversions and interest rates of borrowing are determined according to the rules of the US treasury. Again, the rates in the US treasury are linked to the value of dollar. Most countries giving out loans prefer to do so in dollars as historically the Dollar is strong and trusted not to collapse and hence the money they owe is safe. The countries taking loans also convert their debts to dollars as it is easier and the country to whom the debt is owed cannot just up and change the value of the debt owed by manipulating their currency as dollar has determined the conversion into other currencies at fixed rates, so it is safe for everyone. However, there is a slight problem with this. If you owe a debt of 1 dollar to someone, when you pay the debt, it will depend on the value of dollar to your currency at that particular instant. So if dollar has gotten stronger wrt to your currency, you shall have to pay more money and if the dollar has gotten weaker, you will owe less money in your currency. Hence the fall of the dollar would be beneficial for the countries who owe debt in dollars and bad for the countries who have loaned out debt in dollars.\\n\\nAlso, taking debt in dollars becomes cheaper if the value of dollar falls since the US treasury interest rates are directly tied to dollars, hence it becomes cheaper to borrow in dollars. Also, as I said, if it grows weaker still, yo will owe less money.\\n\\nOne more thing to consider regarding fall of the Dollar is this. Uptil now, the oil producers have been buying US treasury bonds due to the Bretton Woods deal. Other countries and US and other corporations do so too. Now, the US treasury gives a fixed rate of interest to those investing in the treasury. This rate, in turn is linked to the value of the dollar. Stronger the dollar, more the interest on US Treasury bonds and more the foreign countries invest in it. Now this means that these foreign countries would much rather invest their money in US Treasury at an assured fixed rate of interest than invest it in 3rd world countries and take a risk of maybe losing it. However, if the value of dollar were to fall, the countries would much rather draw out of the US treasury and invest more in the startups in different countries, domestically etc.\\n\\nThe other side of the same coin would be the countries dependent on US investment. Should the value of the dollar fall, the investment being received from the US would be of a lesser value.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is one more thinh. Like I said, investments in dollars are governed by the US treasury rules. Now, basically, US banks have cut the taxes on money transfer and conversion, artificially keeping them very low to fuel the domestic and world trade etc . If the dollar were to collapse, people wouldn’t trade in dollars. They would trade in other currencies. The inetrbanking across the world would be then governed by the rules of the currency you trade in, for eg, BRICS nations will follow the tariffs etc of the Shanghai Bank where most of the reserves are held. So that effect would then depend on the rules of the bank you deal with and that can be detrimental or beneficial depending on the bank’s policies compared to the dollar.\\n\\nAlso, countries having holdings in the US treasury would lose the entire value of their foreign reserves. On the other hand coountries like BRICS who have their reserves in other international banks would retain the value of their foreign reserves in those banks.\\n\\nWhat does this mean?\\n\\nIndian Currency would also fall with the fall of the dollar in its current state. Now, we usually run around with the perception that Indian currency is backed by gold, That’s not true. The truth is 99% of today’s currencies US Dollar, Euro, Indian rupee, all of them are fiat currencies i.e. their value is not determined by the gold they hold but by the economic strength of the government. Only an average of 4–7% of any country’s currency is today, backed by gold. US Dollar - 4.5%, Indian rupee - 5%. The rest is held in the terms of foreign reserves in other countries like in the form of US Dollar (around 70%) in US treasury bonds, in world bank or IMF, in other currencies (around 25%) in BRICS and other foreign reserves etc. Currently if you have rs 1000 , only rs 50 is gold, around 670 is held in the form of US dollars and Rs 280 in other currencies. You might ask why is that? Well, remember the Bretton Woods agreement. At that time US had 75% of the world’s gold which backed dollar and dollar backed other currencies so most of the currency of any country was backed directly or indirectly through dollar by gold. Now, it is difficult to keep gold in your country so it was convenient for other countries to just hold foreign reserves in dollars especially with the fixed exchange rates they provided. Hence more and more portion of their currency was being held in dollars. However, after Nixon shock of 1971, dollar removed its gold backing. So, automatically all other currencies that were backed by dollar (99% of the world currencies) also became fiat currencies as a result. However, the dollar was still good and trusted so no one thought much of it, especially since dollars were being printed out of thin air. However, now with the prospect of the trust in dollar fading, this as started to worry some experts. Because of the senseless printing of dollars and in exchange all the fiat currencies, the total amount of currency can nowhere near be compensated by the gold reserves even if all the gold in the world was put together. It would form not more than 10% of the currency in the world. Now, putting this disturbing detail aside, if Dollar were to collapse, 670 rupees of your 1000 would become worthless, too. So, it isn’t wise to hold US dollars, is it? No its, not and many countries have woken up to that fact.\\n\\nChina has been secretly amassing large amounts of gold. OPEC countries have started removing their capital from US treasury. See, these oil producers have been receiving US gold in exchange for trading oil in US dollars and have accumulated holdings in other countries’ treasuries. Now with all the crazy gold they have received they have bought material assets like real estate etc even in other countries. Now, they can simply sell out their US treasury bonds and buy more assets such as gold and real estate from it, which they have been doing in the recent years. Now, this will start depleting the treasury and cause the fall in the value of the dollar in turn causing other countries to withdraw and invest elsewhere. That, coupled with Russia and China doing trade in Roubles and Yuan, India and Iraq trading oil outside of dollar, Germany and China trading outside of Dollar, the strenghtening of BRICS bank etc, Dollar has been showing a steady decline. So India should also wisen up and start replenishing its treasury with gold and sell off holdings in dollars and euros and invest in other currencies on the rise. This is one reason BRICS could be very important for India and other countries in BRICS whether we like it or not. \\n\\nAnother thing that using another currency would do, it would take away the power of the US to slap economic sanctions on whichever country they choose. This is one of the major reasons Putin has teamed up with China - in order to bypass US sanctions.\\n\\n*[Edit: The thing that worries most nations is this - having international trade and foreign reserves in dollars gives US a single handed say on their economies. Just like Nixon's unilateral decision changed the fate of all currencies, other decisions by it can also change their economies. US can dictate their rules and if you don't follow them - sanctions. So the countries want to take back the power of making decisions in their own hands.*\\n\\n*Next, the petrodollar is based on a commodity that is being depleted. Oil reserves are declining and the world is moving towards other sources - gree energy, nuclear energy etc. So the petrodollar decline is destined. However, what would US do next? They could shift to backing their currency with nuclear reserves or some new crazy idea out of someone's hat. That will, inevitably affect all other countries and they want to and should have a say in it.]*\\n\\nOn the other hand, China's attempt to start a gold backed currency may not pan out because like I said all the gold in the world is not sufficient to back all the currencies in the world. Also, since most currencies still have a large amount of dollar backing, fall of the dollar would make that percent of the currency valueless and therefore even having a reserve in another foreign currency could still cause a fall in Indian currency though it might be a little mitigated. On the other hand, fiat currencies are run by the investors' trust in the currency. So even if the dollar falls, a fiat currency with foreign reserves in the dollar may not fall because the confidence in that currency is still high. Sadly, such a currency would be Chinese Yuan. So, the policy to fix this? I am still trying to work on that solution. This is a post in evolution. My thoughts on this are still in evolution and I would really like some economists to come and hold a serious, well informed and sane discussion on this.\\n\\n I will add more when other points occur to me or are brought forward to me in any online or offline discussions.\\n\\nEdit 2 : Also read some interesting discussions I had regarding this :\\n\\n1.

The British recruited heavily from rural Punjab for it’s armed forces, and recognized that is was vital to keep rural Punjab prosperous and satisfied. The government invested heavily in irrigation and enacted laws favorable to farmers. Famine nearly struck Bihar and Maharashtra in the after independence, and the new government was desperate to raise agricultural yields. The government of India embraced the Green Revolution, and no region more than Punjab. Punjab led India in the adoption of high value seeds, irrigation and fertilizer. An entire policy regime was constructed to benefit farmers and to increase food production.\\nHowever, this policy regime is misfiring badly today. The Green Revolution is over in Punjab, and the state is struggling to reorient itself in an economy where agriculture is no longer paramount. Free electricity to farmers to keep pumps running constantly, causing the water table to drop to dangerous levels while starving the state government of the funds necessary to modernize the economy. Today’s podcast episode is about the weight of history on economic development in Punjab and the struggle to transition from the successes of the Green Revolution to a truly modern economy.', \"Before 2014 I was a daily user of quora but once they started there selfless work of promoting government for each and everything and when the crowd of wannabe top writer started throwing senseless answers on stupid question after taking weed. I was forced to quit. But I didn't unsubscribe from Quora digest.\\n\\nEvery alternate week I see there is a question on work related to government in Quora digest. And despite knowing what kind of answer it is going to have 7 out of 10 times, I try to read that. \\nI have seen it all from giving them a little bit of time to proving how good demonetization was. \\n\\nThere is usually a pattern in answers if the question is normal one like, how Modi is performing in his constituency then typically top response have this pattern. \\nFirst, he will put a discloser why he eligible for giving this answer it could be, the writer himself belongs to the same constituency to he visited this place twice, one before 2014 and one after 2014. After that discloser,  couple of pictures from Varanasi in the night from the perfect angle where you can't see the filth. And with that, he will assure you that   Varanasi is literally transformed into a world-class city. Despite the well-known fact that Varanasi is not just restricted to Ghats of Ganga rest of the answer will focus on that, and there will be a rosy picture in front of you. The list put in front of you will mostly a daily news article like Modi gave a gift of x crore to Varanasi and there was a project that started only by great leader etc. Now, what would you expect from a guy who lives there is to put a picture of how his life is changed like electricity, roads and healthcare facility, he is getting after 2014, but no I will throw every random project news about Varanasi without the follow up on that project. Are bahi! ager news article ki project started or gifted vali news headline hi padhni thi to question kyu puchta. \\n\\nAnother instance if the question is about the health of the economy or something like demonetization. Where people are vocal means, there is less excuse to make. Then ignoring all the facts on how government changed his stance from the attack on black money to increasing cashless transaction. The writer will simply put forward his own theory or a new theory produced by Sir Sambit Patra. One of the theory was now the government have a big database of people who submitted their money it will be easy peasy Japanesey to find defaulters. In the end, there will be some statement from hotshot banking firm head backing their theory and proving how India is headed toward glorious future. Despite the well-known fact how crores of money renewed through bank staff as well as through traveling agencies, daily wage workers, and jan dhan account.  \\n\\nThere are some instances where they pull legs on failed policies like make in India and poor river health but don't know how they forget the name of our beloved PM and his party in that answer. It's all about how bad Indian citizen then. If river Ganga is still filthy then only people are responsible about that because they throw religious material in it. But they closed eyes when Mr. Modi along with his fellas dropped religious stuff in the river during the live telecast of Narmada dam inauguration. \\n\\nJustification on how it is just cow cow and cow everywhere is simply it is not new, and it is going on from ages. It was Nehru who started all this. And our beloved leader is so good he never question his elders work. Then why would he question work of Chacha Nehru? He is just following his footstep.\\n\\nJustification on why farmers are dying and rape is a big problem is again it is not new, and the X country is actually a top-ranked country in this. Just don't dare to question our leader.\\nOne of the top writer and flag bearer of Indian diaspora on Quora said something amazing when asked why they act like the lawyer of government. \\n\\n> For the same reason Sachin, Steve Jobs and a variety of people are staunchly defended by their fans. You might not have agreed with every one of Sachin’s shots [especially the silly shots he got out] but would desert him for that?\\nModi was elected by crores of voters. Some of these might have voted because they thought there is no alternative. But, there is a sizeable chunk of voters who voted because they believed. They believe this government is theirs and not some random entity like we have often behaved in the past.\\nIf you assume Modi’s string of victories in state elections is a fluke and that a sizeable chunk of people don’t truly adore him, you don’t understand the evolving Indian politics.\\nIn a way this is democracy - where people feel ownership in the government. Look at US politics and the same happens - where common people feel ownership and stake in politics and fight for their ideology.\\nWhen you believe it is yours, you will fight for it. \\n\\nYeah, I will fight for it, and I will fight for every single penny I gave through tax and different types of cess. And question government why things don't change instead of supporting them for each and every idiotic move.\", \"I live in the US and file IT returns in India online through my bank - no paper trail. I don't have an Aadhaar number. Now I hear that the government is making it mandatory for filing IT returns. What the hell am I supposed to do? Make a trip to India just for getting an Aadhaar number?\\n\\nI don't understand this. As it is, less than 2% of India pays income tax. Last year I paid 2.13 lakh in taxes and got a certificate from the government. But apparently I won't be able to to pay it next year! Why? Because of the damn Aadhaar number!\\n\\nWhy is the government making it MORE difficult for honest citizens to pay their taxes? Development is supposed to smooth things over, not create more hassles! Does the government want to LOWER the tax net? This is such bullshit! Take my fucking money quietly and stop making it difficult for me to pay you.\\n\\nSigned: A frustrated tax payer.\\n\\nSource for mandatory Aadhaar: http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/income-tax-returns-to-require-aadhaar-number-117011901085_1.html .

But he was of tired body and mind post-independence and post-Gandhi assassination.\\n\\nIt\\'s one thing to like historic fables and another to consider them history. There are often efforts to sell these fables as history. But it\\'s time to look for true history. Currently certain fables are sold as history. Some of them are: Sardar Patel was Hindutvavadi and subsequently anti-Muslim, if he was leading the country instead of Nehru then all of our problems (i.e. Pakistan and Jammu-Kashmir) would\\'ve been solved already. Due to wishes of masses, these misunderstandings are considered history. There\\'s effort to sell these fables as history.\\n\\nFirst let\\'s tackle most lethel delusion. That is had Mahatma Gandhi not put his weight behind Pandit Nehru, then Sardar Patel would\\'ve been our first Prime Minister. A most liked fable in halls of Whatsapp university. Reality however, begs to differ. Pandit Nehru wasn\\'t chosen as Prime Minister at the last minute. It had been going under consideration since 1929. At that time Purna Swaraj (Declaration of Independence of India) under consideration which was officially announced on 26 January 1930. It\\'s leadership came easily under Nehru because he was 2nd most popular leader of Indian National Congress after Gandhi. Then there was a challenge of elections as per Government of India Act 1935. For that, there was no other option than to handover the party presidentship to Nehru. The popularity necessary to win the elections was with Gandhi and Nehru. Sardar Patel was main fundraiser and chairman of Congress\\' Central Parliamentary Board at that time. However it meant Nehru had bigger responsibility since as a President, he was the face of the party. That is the reason why in 1942 Gandhi declared him as successor. The whole party stood with him and so strong was the resolve that in 1946 - a year before independence - Maulana Abul Kalam Azad resigned presidentship for Nehru.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting to check the delusions of people who claim Sardar should\\'ve been the Prime Minister. After his release from prison in 1945, he was not in good health. He was struggling with diabetes and blood-pressure and his mind was gloomy because of family issues. He had severe heart attack on 4 March 1948, barely a month after Gandhi assassination. Even doctors had given up hopes. Sardar survived but it took a toll on his health. He had said that next news won\\'t be of my sickness but of my death. He died in December 1950. He didn\\'t live to see first general election in India. Nehru was 15 years younger to him. Sardar belonged to generation of Gandhi and Jinnah and three of them died shortly after independence. Sardar Patel\\'s own words are enough to remove any doubt about his desire for Prime Ministership. \"Desire demands youth and health. We have none.\" He even conceded that the crowd at Bombay rally had \\'come for Jawahar, not for me\\'.\\n\\nThis should tell us how unrealistic it is to claim Sardar for PM.\\n\\n\\nNow let us talk about partition. Sardar Patel was one of the first people to agree to partition proposal by Mountbatten. Nehru accepted it later. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on the other hand, staunchly opposed partition till the end. He was of the opinion that India shouldn\\'t be divided. He himself had written it in his \\'India Wins Freedom\\'. It might be politically incorrect to speak highly of Azad in current political climate. But it is documented history. Patel was first one to accept the truth that it isn\\'t right to make Hindus suffer for dream of Undivided India. Nehru and Gandhi followed him to accept the bitter reality. So all three of them are equally \\'responsible\\' for partition. It is  politically convenient to blame partition on Gandhi and Nehru. But it isn\\'t reality. \\n\\nFinally, let\\'s talk about his love for Hindutva. He had none as documented by many historians and journalists such as Narhar Kurundkar, Govindrao Talvalkar, Ramchandra Guha, Rafiq Zakaria, even American Vincent Sheean. He had major role in giving religious roles to Indian Muslims. Minority Institues also have special rights thanks to Patel. He never opposed leadership of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan in Northwest region, nor did he oppose Shaikh Abdulla in Kashmir. Not just that, but he never felt to limit rights of Indian Muslims after creation of Pakistan. It is also history that he had admonished Uttar Pradesh\\'s then Chief Minister  Govind Vallabh Pant after idols of Rama were placed in Babri Masjid in 1949. He was of the opinion of resolving the matter through talks. There\\'s also no example of Patel giving different treatment to Hindu and Muslim rulers of Princely states. Hindu Maharaja of Travancore intended to stay independent. So there\\'s no reason to claim that Patel\\'s politics was motivated by religion.  Infact, his outlook towards RSS changed after Gandhi Assassination. Even though the ties between RSS and Gandhi Assassinations were never proved, he was of the opinion to ban it along with Hindu Mahasabha. \\n\\n----\\n\\nA reader called me to accuse that \"your favourite JRD had said, if Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today\". I spoke with him and by the end of the call he had change of heart. Why? Let\\'s see.\\n\\nHistory tells us that Gandhi\\'s economic policies were opposed by Nehru and Patel and two of them also had difference of opinion about it. Nehru\\'s economic policies had layer of naive socialism. Which gave birth to state-owned enterprises. It spread so much that goverment was making wristwatches. Nationalization was core of his economic policies. It\\'s as if he hated the idea of profit. \\n\\nJRD and Nehru had disagreement about this point. JRD was of the opinion that it\\'s not government\\'s job to run airline company. It should be noted that JRD\\'s favourite child, Air India was nationalized by Nehru. Patel agreed with JRD on opinion that businesses should be left to businessmen. JRD\\'s opinion was in this context, \"if Sardar Patel was a younger mand and had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today\"\\n\\nNow the caller didn\\'t take into account Patel\\'s health. Nor did JRD speak about Nehru\\'s popularity and politics. His only focus for comparison was economy.\\n\\nNow let\\'s come to present. Nehru\\'s economic policies were criticised by many political parties, including the one currently in power. The criticism includes inefficieny, irresponsibilty, unnecessary hirings and expenses etc. \\n\\nNarasimha Rao took stand against this love for state-owned enterprises. Him and Manmohan Singh opned the doors for economic liberalization. Rao was throughly Congressman. But he didn\\'t hesitate to throw policies of his predecessor in the can. Atal Bihari\\'s government came close to Rao\\'s. He pushed privatization and sold state enterprises operating at loss. As a member of BJP he had right to can Nehru. \\n\\nNow Vaypayee\\'s party came to power in 2014. This part is business-friendly and progressive. So it was a given that PSU\\'s will get evem more freedom. Sins of Congress had resulted in loss in banks, air india, and other state enterprises. The BJP\\'s admiration for Patel meant that even more economic improvements would be done. As a sign of their admiration, this goverment decided to build a monument for Patel. So far Congressis had ignored Patel so these people decied to build a statue so tall, you could not ignore it. That\\'s how you pay tribute to your heros!\\n\\nAround 3000 crores Rupees were spent for this glorious monument. Who paid for it? The caller didn\\'t know. \\n\\nSo this is the list of generous people who contributed to this monument, in Rupees:\\n\\n- Indian Oil - 900 Crores\\n\\n- Oil and Natural Gas Commission - 500 Crores\\n\\n- Bharat Petroleum - 450 Crores\\n\\n- Hindustan Petroleum - 250 Crores\\n\\n- Oil India - 250 Crores\\n\\n- Gas Authority of India - 250 Crores\\n\\n- Power Grid - 125 Crores\\n\\n- Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation - 100 Crores\\n\\n- Engineers India - 50 Crores\\n\\n- Petronet India - 50 Crores\\n\\n- Balmer Lawrie - 6 Crores\\n\\nDoes the list ring any bell? All of these are Government owned companies. Who were born because of Nehruvian economics and policies,  which was opposed by Sardar Patel. And his monument is now funded by the same companies.\\n\\nAnd the money comes from Corporate Social Responsibility funds of these companies, even written down for preservation ofr arts and culture by some of them.\\n\\nWho is preserving whose which legacy?

First the easy stuff:\\n\\n**Preconsultation paper on Net Neutrality**: Includes all the issues remaining from the consultation last year in March, when all of us got involved for the first time. /u/shadowbannedguy1 has a submission he sent to this. \\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4lucjl/the_trai_has_a_new_consultation_paper_on_net/\\nImportant to note that this isn't a consultation but a preconsultation paper. This means there's more to follow. O_O\\n\\n**Consultation paper on Throttling:** will follow after the pre-consultation paper mentioned above. We have to be careful about telcos getting fast lanes for specialized services, and also them having the ability to charge netflix and youtube a congestion fee, because it takes away from the rest of access.\\n\\n**Consultation paper on licensing of Internet Telephony**: will follow after the consultation paper mentioned above. It is likely that the two consultations will be separate because the TRAI can regulate throttling under QoS (Quality of Service), but it can only recommend licensing of Internet Telephony/VoIP. I remember hearing that the VoIP consultation will take place in July, but you never know. This will be a tough one to win (as in, no licensing) because the MHA wants it to snoop on your calls, and pretty much everyone in the government would want access to VoIP. Telcos are arguing regulatory arbitrage, and the DoT had recommended licensing. TRAI seems to be open to the idea of recommending this. To quote the TRAI Chairman: \\n“An application is providing the same service that a telecom company is providing. TSP provides the service under a licence, communications-based OTT don't provide it under any licence. There is a regulatory imbalance.” [Source](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/52528968.cms)\\n\\n**Now the clear and present danger**\\n\\n**Consultation paper on Free Data**\\nTRAI has issued a consultation paper on free data, looking at models which allow giving free data to users. It says now that it is considering models which allow an independent platform (not a telco) to zero rate itself, or give free data for how much data was consumed. We hadn't focused on this extensively in the last consultation and we thought data back was kosher, but on further examination, we're don't think it is: We're opposing data back related to consumption of data because it has the same impact as zero rating of an individual site or a group of sites. The only difference between this model and airtel zero is that data consumed is being given back to a user after data usage, instead of during data usage. So, I use 11.3 mb of wynk, and the platform gives me 11.3 mb. It doesn't dictate that I use the 11.3 mb only for wynk, but it has effectively made my cost of using wynk zero. The TRAI chairman has also made some worrying statements:\\n\\n“Free Basics had essentially tied up with Reliance Communications. So, if you went through the Reliance pipe, these sites were free. If you went through the Airtel or Vodafone pipes, these sites were not free. It's as though a shop in (Delhi's) Connaught Place is giving discounts but to only those who come in a bus provided by Mr X. If you don't come by that bus, no discount. That is not a good thing. If you give a secular discount, it is fine.” [Source](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/we-had-a-problem-with-free-basics-because-it-gave-free-data-only-to-those-who-went-through-rcom-pipe-ram-sevak-sharma-116053000014_1.html) \\n\\n[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. \\n\\nP.s.: Apologies for the delay, but many of us had to go back to our actual jobs (and a couple of us had a pretty big mess to deal with because we were away from work for most of last year). So it's been tough getting ourselves going again, but a few of us have put in a lot of work over the past four days on this. This will be our 5th participation, after TRAI, DoT, Parliamentary Standing Committee and TRAI again, since March last year. \\n\\nYou'll also notice that the submission is from the Internet Freedom Foundation.

It is a great read and a different perspective altogether. It would be great if you guys can share your views on the post. \\n\\nWARNING - Long wall of text\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHO IS BULLYING BHUTAN?\\n\\nOn 26th June 2017, The Times of India posted a video on YouTube claiming to show Chinese and Indian troops jostling and shoving each other on what The Times commentator said is “Indian land” on the “Indian side” of the Sikkim border. He accused China of “aggression” and the Chinese troops of being “extremely aggressive.”\\n\\nA few days later, it emerged that the dispute had nothing to do with Indian land. The China-India confrontation was taking place on the China-Bhutan border. Yet Chinese and Indian media quickly roused patriotic fervour and railed against each other.\\n\\nChinese media said India would be “kicked out”, “taught a bitter lesson” and “suffer greater losses than in 1962. One Chinese editorial mocked India’s claim to be defending Bhutan and accused India of treating Bhutan as a “vassal state” and forcing it to support India.\\n\\nMeanwhile an Indian headline read: “China: The World’s Bully”, and another article called China “a geopolitical bully….The mere fact that a vastly bigger country like China is indulging in such antics against a peaceful neighbour like Bhutan shows the extent to which Beijing will stoop to, to occupy territory illegally, slicing it off like a salami, just like it's done with India.”\\n\\nThrough such welter of mutual recriminations and accusations, Bhutan’s media remained remarkably quiet and reserved, with “no aggressive posturing”, as reported by the Hindustan Times. And why should there be? The vast majority of Bhutanese have no interest in the remote, barren, high altitude Doklam Plateau, and have not even heard of it.\\n\\nBut the 89 sq.km. parcel does have strategic importance to India that sees Chinese presence there as a “dagger” pointed at its narrow and vulnerable 21-km wide “chicken’s neck” that links it to its northeastern states. And so, Bhutan’s initial quiet restraint was not good enough for India, and Bhutan quickly fell into line.\\nOn 3rd July FirstPost headlines read: “Bhutan vents out first major disclaimer against Chinese, sides with India…” The article went on to say: “Bhutan, for the first time has taken a major stand against China's incursions …. Bhutan's stand against Beijing… goes on to show the country's unwavering alliance and support for big brother India.”\\nAnd that characterization itself raises a big question: Who precisely is bullying Bhutan? And what exactly are Indian troops doing on Bhutanese land in the first place? Just defending poor little Bhutan against big China’s bullying “aggression”? Who, in fact, is more seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence – China or India?\\n\\nWhen “friendship” turns to control.\\n\\nIn fact, India has maintained a strong military presence throughout Bhutan for half a century, exercising its power and influence in every corner of Bhutanese life. Even in the remote and strategic areas of northern Bhutan, far from anything Indian, Indian soldiers exercise their authority and control the movement of local Bhutanese. Convoys of Indian military trucks travel freely across Bhutan and cannot be checked for contents by the Bhutanese authorities. The Indian army has occupied the Haa Dzong for decades, and has given no indication of handing it back to the Bhutanese. The Dzongs have since the time of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the founder of Bhutan, been a seat of power and a symbol of governance.\\nIt is noteworthy that Indian troops’ efforts to block Chinese road construction on the Bhutan border are portrayed in Indian media as stopping China from building roads into India – revealing just how little respect the Indians really have for Bhutanese “sovereignty.” But such spin is not surprising. In Bhutan, the IMTRAT (Indian Military Training) General, and Indian Ambassador both residing in the two most prized real estates in the capital, are said to be the most powerful men in the country, even determining what does and does not get published in the national media.\\n\\nWhen Bhutan obtained Asian Development Bank funding for a strategic highway linking its east and west, to avoid the necessity of Bhutanese travel through troubled, strike-prone and often violent Assam and West Bengal, India vetoed the plan. The highway was cancelled and Bhutan remains dependent on India’s grace and mercy for its own internal east-west transit. Just a few weeks ago an angry mob of Indians beat up a Bhutanese truck driver and set his truck on fire for being involved in a road accident.\\nBut this Indian interference and infringement on Bhutanese sovereignty extends far beyond the military-strategic sphere into every aspect of Bhutan’s political and economic life.\\n\\nThus, Bhutan is the only sovereign independent nation in the world that has no diplomatic relations with any of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members – the US, UK, France, China and Russia – only because India, jealous of its exclusive hegemony over Bhutan and fearful of any competitive influence, won’t allow it.\\nJapan has long been a friend of Bhutan, helping fund many developmental projects in Bhutan. The Japanese wished to have an embassy in Bhutan, to foster closer ties and more development projects. However, firm plans and agreement to build a Japanese Embassy in Thimphu were abruptly cancelled, once again due to India’s disapproval.\\n\\nWhen China invited Bhutan to exhibit at its Shanghai EXPO in 2010, offering a free pavilion that would be a central installation in the EXPO, India forbade Bhutanese participation. Independent sovereign nations from the world over took part in the EXPO sans Bhutan. India, even if they forbade Bhutan, went and participated in the EXPO, even building a pavilion of their own. India regularly nixes Bhutanese official and commercial missions and visits to China, though it conducts its own with impunity, apparently due to Indian disapproval of potential competition with its own overweening influence.\\n\\nMore ominously, India has blatantly interfered in Bhutan’s elections and political processes. India strongly objected to Bhutan’s former Prime Minister forging extensive new diplomatic ties and carving out an independent foreign policy, and was furious when the Prime Minister simply met and talked with China’s Premier at the Rio + 20 conference. And so, India decided to get rid of him.\\nJust days before the 2013 elections, India removed its subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene, thereby doubling and tripling prices on these essential commodities, to signal its disapproval of the existing government. The cynical tactic worked, and a new government far more compliant and obedient to India’s will and interests was elected.\\n\\nHydropower – cooperation or colonization?\\nBut the cornerstone of India-Bhutan “cooperation” for three decades has been the hydropower that is a cheap power boon to India’s growing economy, and which accounts for fully 40% of Bhutan’s revenues and 25% of its GDP. Indian financing, which has switched from 70% grant and 30% loan to 30% grant and 70% loan at higher interest rates, is also the direct cause of Bhutan’s escalating debt that has even further deepened Bhutanese dependence on India.\\n\\nSince, July 2006, when Bhutan and India agreed to develop 10,000 MW of hydropower from ten large projects, the benign sheen of this apparent cooperation has quickly faded as commissioned projects were delayed and costs mushroomed. Costs jumped $US 240 million at Mangdechhu; they doubled at Punatsangchhu–II, and they tripled at Punatsangchhu–I (from $US 500 million to $1.5 billion), and no end in sight.\\nAnd those costs obviously don’t include massive environmental damages for which future generations of Bhutanese will pay. A recent report from India documented severe impacts on water bodies and resources, forest and wildlife loss, and heavy pollution. The same report, reinforced by Bhutan’s own government statistics, notes that hydropower has failed to develop local capacity and employment, with most contracts going to Indian companies.\\nAccording to the IMF, Bhutan’s government debt now stands at a whopping 118% of GDP up from just 67% six years ago, with India by far the largest creditor, accounting for 64% of Bhutan’s total debt. By comparison, India’s ratio of government debt to GDP is 70% and China’s is 46%. Why does that ratio matter? Because it’s used by investors to measure a country’s ability to make future payments on its debt, thus affecting the country borrowing costs. Higher borrowing costs worsen debt further.\\n\\nA recent British report on global debt lists Bhutan as one “among 14 other countries that are fast heading towards a debt crisis.” The report details hydropower’s rapid loss of economic viability, and concludes: “Should the hydropower sector’s financial performance continue to deteriorate, Bhutan’s solvency could be threatened.”\\nHow convenient will that be for India? And what conditions will it attach to bailouts and pleas for loan forgiveness?\\nIn this day and age, sovereignty and independence are much more likely undermined by economic than political control, albeit in far more subtle and hidden ways. So, the definition of “bullying” these days must go far beyond the old-fashioned geopolitical border disputes, however minor and insignificant, that still make for good press in TV images of jostling Chinese and Indian soldiers.\\n\\nTime to ask hard questions – that can’t be publicly asked in Bhutan!\\n\\nIt’s time, if not long overdue, to question how benign India’s intentions are in Bhutan. How much “cooperation” is actually “exploitation” and “domination? And, how much of India’s foreign aid to Bhutan (now nearly $US1 billion a year) actually signifies mounting control and interference on one side and growing dependence and erosion of sovereignty on the other?\\n\\nBut of course, with Indian control of Bhutanese expression and politics, those questions will never be asked in Bhutan’s supposed free “democracy”. Just imagine if Bhutan’s daily Kuensel newspaper or its state-run Bhutan Broadcasting Service radio and television dared to publish this article. Unimaginable! How ironic that India, the world’s largest democracy that prides itself on its own free speech, utterly suppresses it in its “friendly neighbour”.\\nAnd here’s another question equally impossible to ask: How might it benefit Bhutan to warm up a bit more to China, and even to establish diplomatic relations with its huge northern neighbour, cooperate economically, and welcome selective Chinese aid and investments in Bhutan’s infrastructure?\\nAfter all, our connection with China already goes far beyond the political and economic to a deep cultural and spiritual affinity. For example, Bhutan shares directly with China the profound wisdom, texts and traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. China today is experiencing an unprecedented Buddhist revival that creates a natural and intuitive bond with Bhutan.\\n\\nIn fact, Bhutan is already benefitting directly from the resurgence of Buddhism in China. From one end of Bhutan to the other, from the giant Shakyamuni Buddha statue at Kuensel Phodrang in Thimphu to the giant Guru Rinpoche statue at Takila in Lhuentse, monasteries, temples, ceremonies and rituals are maintained, sponsored and supported through Chinese donations and contributions.\\n\\nFor all the fawning gratitude, praise, and adulation Bhutanese officials regularly heap on India for its “special relations” with Bhutan, what word of acknowledgement or appreciation do these officials ever utter for the steady, quiet Chinese support for our precious Bhutanese culture and traditions? Support, incidentally, that comes with “no strings attached” and no crippling debt burden!!\\n\\nAnd this shared culture and tradition is a major reason for the surge in Chinese tourists flocking to Bhutan, now greatly outnumbering tourists from any other country. And while the Chinese all pay top dollar on expensive tourist visas to visit Bhutan, thus making China by far the largest contributor to Bhutan’s tourism industry, Indian visitors come for free, requiring no visa of any kind. Sorry to say this, but ask any hotel owner in the country who their least favourite, least respectful and most troublesome guests are, and they unfailingly say “Indians”.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed with India and promised to sign the South Asian Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA). This would open up Bhutan to cars from India, Nepal and Bangladesh; further strengthening India’s hold on Bhutan. Just imagine Bhutan’s roads filled with Indian cars, taxis, buses and trucks. Indian tourists would come in busloads, totally over running Bhutan’s carefully planned ‘quality of quantity’ tourism policy that has helped protect Bhutan. Indian presence would increase, Bhutan’s roads would be destroyed by the increased traffic, resulting in more DANTAK presence to come ‘repair and maintain’ the roads, our pristine environment would be destroyed. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed to sign this agreement, even if the National Assembly of Bhutan has voted against it. Showing how he is willing to do whatever the Indians want.\\nAnd despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Bhutan’s commercial relations with China are already quietly flourishing beneath the surface – all the way from yak-herders on Bhutan’s northern borders to Thimphu merchants dependent on Chinese imports, whose quality often far exceeds comparable Indian products.\\n\\nIn short, might Bhutan benefit in more ways than one by slipping away from total domination by one of its neighbours and instead strategically playing off and leveraging China-India competition to its own advantage?\\nBut questions (let alone policies and solutions) like these are an unwritten “no go zone” in Bhutanese politics and media. Indeed, it is a telling mark of the sinister extent and penetration of Indian control and subjugation of Bhutan that no politician or journalist dare touch such questions with a ten-foot pole.\\n\\nInterestingly, India is unwittingly aided in such suppression of free speech and other human rights by the utter failure of western human rights groups even to notice. Rather the west seems intent on drawing attention to human rights violations in countries like China, which has grown so rapidly into an economic powerhouse that its global reach now threatens western interests. Conveniently for India, it poses no such threat and escapes western scrutiny.\\n\\nYes, China may occasionally though very rarely “flex its muscles” in minor border disputes, as India accuses. But compared to Bhutan’s actual ground-level experience and interaction with China, isn’t India’s domination and subjugation of Bhutan far more intrusive, pervasive and insidious, extending into every portion of Bhutan’s social, political and economic fabric?\\n\\nAre there any Bhutanese out there who dare even to ask?\", '', '*While claiming that “all the requisite steps… have been followed”, the 16-page submission makes it clear the government did not take the most basic steps that are fundamental to any procurement and which are spelt out in detail in the Defence Procurement Policy of 2013 (DPP-2013), which governed the 36-Rafale purchase*.\\n\\n[Business-Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/rafale-row-govt-submission-to-sc-hints-at-shortcuts-in-decision-making-118111300039_1.html)', 'Will he ever focus on other news?

He writes the following –\\n\\n>\"The Delhi games showed the world just what can be done when it\\'s daunting civil service takes control – and the result wasn’t pretty. Corruption, waste, inefficiency, obfuscation and a cancerous lack of accountability in officialdom – and all of it on an Olympian scale.\\n\\n>Delhi’s dramas may have been revealing for observers who briefly touch India but sadly these are the common issues daily confronting and long bedeviling a billion Indians and the foreign investors urged to invest their money in business there. Some economists have calculated that India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs the country 1 to 2 points in annual growth.\\n\\n>India’s daunting civil service is supposed to be the pride of the nation – just ask its privileged nabobs – but instead its malfunction and misgovernance hold India back. Enter any average government office in India and one is struck by the mountains of yellowing paperwork, years of filing and unfinished work ground down by the sheer scale of chaotic India’s myriad issues that overwhelm.\"\\n\\n\\nAnother account by Lant Pritchett of Harvard University sheds some brighter light on the Indian bureaucratic problem. In a paper, in 2009, titled “Is India a Failing State?“, he described Indian bureaucracy to be one of the most serious problems in the world today; up there with AIDS and climate change. He makes a point that foreign investments, and any welfare schemes in India for that matter, will never improve India’s economy as long as there is an inefficient Indian bureaucracy. These bureaucrats are like a tumorous growth that eat away any welfare funds like a parasite.\\n\\nIn his book “The Foundation Pillars for Change: Our Nation, Our Democracy & Our Future”, **Mr. V.K. Patel** writes that *most developmental spending fails to reach its intended recipients. It is either diverted or misused by a sizeable and a complacent bureaucracy.* I corroborate to Mr. Patel’s description of bureaucracy.\\n\\n*We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds. Unless and until such an overhaul happens, India is not going to be a great country. No welfare policies will ever come to fruition. India cannot change without a change in our bureaucratic system. This is what is wrong with the Indian bureaucracy.*', 'Here is the article https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/9dXAdm4kiXGzhiLzbq3lqM/Narendra-Modi-governments-report-card-A-for-a-more-robus.html\\n\\nIs this sarcasm? I mean, most of the things mentioned in this article are detrimental to the common man. Highlights include:\\n\\n* Growth in rural wages has been curtailed. This ensures that the reserve army of the underemployed continues to exert a downward pressure on wages.\\n* The ruling party’s ideology of religious nationalism has the merit of distracting the attention of the masses waiting impatiently for the fruits of development to trickle down. The hard work put in by the ruling party’s grassroots organizations has done much to steer away the poorer castes and classes from militant demands that interfere with the process of capital accumulation. As the Roman satirist Juvenal said, it is necessary to provide both bread and circuses to the masses.\\n* The presence of a strong charismatic leader is a big help in developing an anti-liberal mass base and ensuring right-wing policies are implemented. The government has done its best to neutralize the left wing and has placed its nominees in crucial positions in important institutions. Recall that all the East Asian miracle economies had their growth spurts under autocratic governments.\\n\\nWhy would they publish something that is written like this?', '', '', '', '', '', '', \"Edit: So people are suggesting these sources-\\n\\n* **Times of India** (In Advertisement business, not news)\\n* **Russia Today** (State owned Russian Propaganda)\\n* **Niticentra** (Right aligned Propaganda)\\n* **OpIndia** (Very right Aligned)\\n* **TruthOfGujarat** (Propaganda)\\n* **CounterCurrents** (Bullshit!)\\n* **indiasamvad.co.in** (Spreads Rumours and sensationalism)\\n* **indiafacts.co.in** (Spreads Rumours and sensationalism)\\n* **Scroll.in** (Shit website, poor quality)\\n* **JantaKaReporter** (BullShit!)\\n* **Firstpost** (Sensationalism and left aligned)\\n* **thewire.in** (Left Aligned, Poor Articles)\\n* **Shanknaad** (Crap, read it only for Lulz)\\n* **Scoopwhoop** (Clickbait articles)\\n* **Tehelka** (well researched but Biased)\\n* **Cobra post** (well researched but Biased)\\n* **Kafila** (well researched but Biased)\\n* **Caravan** (well researched but Biased)\\n* **NDTV** (Yellow Journalism, sensationalism) \\n* **IBN** (Yellow Journalism, sensationalism)\\n* **The Hindu** (Very Left Aligned)\\n* **The Indian Express** (Left Leaning)\\n* **storypick** (Clickbait, poor articles)\\n* **Mid-day** (Yellow Journalism)\\n* **DNA** (Right Aligned)\\n* **Economics Times** (Not in News Business, Same as TOI)\\n* **Hindustan Times** (Left Aligned)\\n* **Daily mail** (British Shit paper)\\n* **The Independent** (Sensationalism, Yellow Journalism, Clickbait)\\n* **Xinhua** (Chinese State Owned Propaganda)\\n* **The Logical Indian** (Pro AAP, Very left Aligned, Avoid it Altogether)\\n* **New Indian Express** (Left Aligned)\\n* **Dailyo** (Shit website, And crap material)\\n* **Outlook** (Left Aligned)\\n* **The week** (Left Aligned)\\n* **Milli Gazette** (Pro Muslim)\\n* **The statesman** (Left Aligned)\\n* **Swarajya Magazine** (Right Aligned)\\n* **The Telegraph** (Right Aligned)\\n* **The Sun** (Avoid it at all Cost)\\n* **DailyDot** (Crap)\\n* **MensXP** (Clickbait)\\n* **buzzfeed** (Clickbait)\\n* **Al Jazeera** (Propaganda outlet for Qatari Government)\\n* **India Today** (Sensationalism)\\n* **Outlook** (Sensationalism)\\n* **Frontline** (Very Left Aligned)\\n\\n\\n\\nI will add more.

But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful. \\n \", \"Hello fellow randians! \\n\\nThis might be a long rant but I think it might be affecting a lot of us here. Earlier, i.e. pre GST most restaurants and online food ordering places had their menus adjusted to whatever taxes they paid earlier and had figures like 199/299/500 etc. inclusive of all taxes. The breakup between the service and the tax used to be shown in the bill and didn't matter much as the bill was what I knew I was paying. \\n\\nNow in comes GST! The grand scheme supposed to propel the Indian economy to nobody knows what heights. :| \\n\\nMost restaurants and online places here in Bangalore just shamelessly add GST to the final bill and the justification is that it's mandatory. Now, I know it's mandatory for them, but what about the food prices? Practically none have adjusted their prices to take out the tax component that used to be added before. Case in point here is freshmenu. Great food, great service everything but then this. Had been noticing this since some time but just can't keep it in anymore.\\n\\nNot just food, malls etc. now show the price without the GST so you're in for a rude shock when the cashier tells you the final amount. Didn't used to be the same amount earlier either but now it's way more than what you'd have thought.\\n\\nI used to admire the current government a lot. Liked the statesman Modi used to appear. Still respect him for the foreign policy that seems to be going in the right direction. But at the end of the day/month I do have to take a look at my wallet. And frankly, I've been let down. Can't be too enthusiastic about a government that's continually taking steps to rip me of my money. I pay all my taxes regularly and do so happily, knowing that it'll be used for the nation, but to what extent do I keep paying up? \\n\\nThe previous government used to be in news for various scams and the level of corruption used to be mind-boggling. But sorry to say, it never directly affected me or most of my acquaintances. I'm in no way justifying them, but at least they let the middle class grow independently. This government seems to be hell bent on killing it. And it's all done legally, so no one can really say anything. \\n\\nI'll go on a limb to say that the middle class consumption was driving the economic growth in this country since the last 15 years and with the measures that the govt is taking they're sure to kill it by making the middle class more conservative with their spending. And honestly, I'm actually wishing that it goes out next election. Well aware there's no other option we can actually vote for, but so so hoping that one comes up.\\n\\nEnd of rant. Sorry. Bye! \", '', \"Indians often like to call India a counterbalance to China and it's influence in Asia. However as of now I don't see that happening. What I see happening however is China's autocratic leadership isn't able to squash it's own people. Which leads to social and political unrest causing an economic slowdown. This will take 30-40 years at the minimum. At this point though, India is large enough an economy that it starts taking over the mantle from China about Asian leadership. And genuinely rises in influence and power to be called a superpower. Do you see that happening? And which factors will actually hasten this process? Some dramatic changes in policy? Takeover from an authoritarian regime (some would argue we're in one right now)? \\n\\nWould love to hear your thoughts.\", \"First thing first, Now that Raghuram Rajan is out.\\nNext thing on Modi's List is to appoint his one more chamcha, as this has been followed across multiple appointments in recent times, and i am betting all my shares on Arvind Panagarhia, the guy with a record for licking his ass.\\nWhat next you ask?\\nWell, pretty easy to guess in next monetary policy review meeting u will get a massive rate cut to pump cheap money in order to boost manufacturing and consumption\\nwell this might seems good in a very short run will have a really bad impact on our robust fundamentals built by rajan over the long period of time.\\nThe same bad fundamentals which have resulted in a bad economy in many western countries and experiencing hard time passing over it.\\nI am being cynical here, but i guess thats grand picture by modi, to show this mirage to fellow indians who will make sure to vote him in power again  in 2019!\\nI am open to more ideas and predictions\", '', \"####Last Week in Indian Economy\\n\\n*Sorry for the politically biased content in the last edition of Last Week In Indian Economy.

This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.\\n\\n\\n**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**\\n\\nHeartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.\\n\\n**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**\\n\\nIndian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.\\n\\n**Are Diamonds Forever?**\\n\\nThat’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.\\n\\n**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**\\n\\nIn Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.\\n\\n***\\n###Sidebar Stories\\n***\\n\\n* The Bombay Stock Exchange has probably helped thousands of companies to go public and list on the stock market - but it has never listed itself.
