If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\\n\\n2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\\n\\n3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.\\n\\n4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\\n\\n5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\\n\\n#####Share your Idle CPU/GPU Power towards find solutions for Covid-19\\n\\n&gt;Do you have a CPU/GPU sitting at home, not doing anything?

I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.\\n\\n>Our Business - What we do\\n\\nOur business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.\\n\\n>How has the lockdown affected my business?\\n\\nBeing a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.\\n\\nMe along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.\\n\\nThis worked smoothly with some hitches of course.\\n\\nIn January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.\\n\\nBut the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.\\n\\nOne thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.\\n\\nI had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.\\n\\nI wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.\\n\\nI'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.\\n\\n>The finances\\n\\nI'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.\\n\\n>What do I mean exactly? \\n\\nNow, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.\\n\\nI'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.\\n\\nI have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.\\n\\nBut I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.\\n\\nI come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.\\n\\nI'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.\\n\\nI'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.\\n\\nI'm going to try and sleep now.
