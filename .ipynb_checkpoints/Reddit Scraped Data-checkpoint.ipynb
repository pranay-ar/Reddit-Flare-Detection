* Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub\\n * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze\\n * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell\\n * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell\\n* Don't\\n * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean\\n\\n#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)\\n^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.\\n\\n^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.\\n\\n1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\\n\\n2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\\n\\n3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.\\n\\n4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\\n\\n5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\\n\\n----\\n\\n#####Share your Idle CPU/GPU Power towards find solutions for Covid-19\\n\\n* Do you have a CPU/GPU sitting at home, not doing anything?

Experts suggest social distancing as the best way to ensure lower spread of disease, forcing the government to finally act and ensure shutdown measures, so that our especially overwhelmed healthcare system doesn’t get even more so.\\nThe name of this Novel (new) Coronavirus is now SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) since it being a cousin(not sibling, for that’s reserved for its mutations) of the SARS Coronavirus, a virus responsible for the 2003 SARS pandemic which spread primarily in the South Eastern Countries, and caused 770 deaths and 8000 infected people worldwide;\\n\\nHere’s the case, since this is a new virus in town, we cannot possibly diagnose an infected person without testing him/her, this is NOT a seasonal fever/flu virus, this is 10 times deadlier, and has an incubation period (time it can stay alive inside human body) of 14 days, unlike the 3 days of seasonal flu.\\nAlso, a person who is a carrier(who has the virus inside, but doesn’t fall sick) will be better able to spread the virus, compared to a sick person who gets noticed and screened out!\\nBest example of this being the 19 year old (way out of high-risk age groups of 60 years & above) Pizza Delivery guy, with no foreign travel history, in Delhi who tested positive, resulting in 70 families being quarantined.\\nPoint I am trying to make here is that, that you can’t confirm Covid-19 cases, until you have enough Covid-19 tests done.\\nIndia’s share of Covid-19 tests is 0.2 for every 1000 people!\\nThe Math: Total population of our country being 1,350,689,521, divided by 2,86,714 number of tests (according to last night’s data) would be 4710.92, which per thousand, is 0.21.\\nMeaning India has only conducted 0.2 tests per 1000 people, one of the lowest in the world, and the lowest in per capita.\\nConcurrently, the places with highest number of cases also are the ones who conducted the most number of tests, which isn’t mere coincidence.\\nThe Propaganda: As of writing this, India has 13,425 positive cases with 446 deaths, and 1756 recovered, which is being hailed as monumental achievement, compared to other developed countries who have much more sophisticated healthcare systems than we can even imagine. This narrative being pushed by the Authorities is even bigger reason to worry than the pandemic since it is based on either them duping themselves, or the people, either way, we all lose.\\n\\nThe dunning Kruger: Dr RR Gangakhedkar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said in a statement that, India is conducting 24 test for every one positive case diagnosed, which is much higher than Japan’s 11.7, Italy’s 6.7, & US’ 5.3. Quite frankly this metric escapes my understanding, because:\\n\\nIf we can conduct tests for 24 individuals for every single positive case, and if the growth trends in the cases follow, then we’ll be able to test each and every one of 1.3 billion citizens in a couple of weeks. Not sure there are currently enough test kits in the world, let alone in India, for pulling off such a feat.\\n\\nSay out of a sample of 500 of such 24 individuals’ tests, we get one positive case(optimistically speaking), then currently we have 1,12,557 infected people who haven’t been diagnosed yet, a number which will significantly spike, by the time they are identified, let alone tested.', '', 'My parents are still forcing our maid come to our place.

Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.\\n\\nSo here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids).

And is being consistently working towards its goal.\\n\\nThe way media is behaving in last few years, it seems we are inching more and more towards a totalitarian form of government. The idea that media can be effectively used to control and sway public sentiments is not new. One of the earliest major successes stories when the media was used in this manner comes from Nazi Germany. I will quote some relevant paragraphs from [Mein Kampf](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54153/page/n3/mode/2up) (particularly Chapter 6 War Propaganda) which seems to be like the cookbook for our present incumbents.\\n\\nSecond it is not dumb. In case you are wondering that the \"intellectual level\" of the media has dropped, it is talking to the masses who are not \"intellectual\". It is by design that the content has been \"dumbed down\"\\n\\n> To whom should  propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or to the less educated masses? \\n\\n> It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses. \\n\\n> What the intelligentsia — or those who today unfortunately \\noften go by that name — what they need is not propaganda but scientific instruction. The content of propaganda is not science  any more than the object represented in a poster is art.\\n\\n> All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. \\n\\n> It is not the purpose of propaganda to provide a series of thrills with a view to pleasing these blase gentry. Its chief function is to convince the masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be given time in order that they may absorb information; and only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd. \\n\\n\\nAbout the persistence of the themes, the Hindu-Muslim divide, the \"other\",\\n\\n> Any variation must not alter the main theme of the propaganda, but must always emphasize the same point. The slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end the stress must always be laid on the slogan itself. In this way alone can propaganda be consistent and dynamic in its effects. \\n\\n> Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly, with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then we shall be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results that such a persistent policy secures. The success of any advertisement, whether of a business or a political nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance with which it is employed.
