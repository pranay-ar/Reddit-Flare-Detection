His work made him file public interest litigation against the illegal voter deletions by ECI using Aadhaar and NPR data.\\n\\nOn our request, he sent us the following text explaining the significance of NPR.\\n\\n> The national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan. The project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when India realised it can't identify the foreigners from indians. During a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001, the project was approved. Part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed Multi Purpose National Identity Cards, which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip. While this project was being piloted, India went through another attack on 26/11/08 in Mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen.  This is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on. \\n\\n> But post 26/11, due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like NATGRID, CCTNS, CMS, Aadhaar poppped up. Aadhaar project and NPR were very similar. So to deal with it, the cabinet combined both of them, the registar general of india became a registrar under UIDAI and started distributing Aadhaar. The deal was NPR will get biometrics from UIDAI post de-duplication, but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyone. \\n\\n> After all of this, NPR project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015. The project in itself is the start of National Register of Citizens. NPR data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residents.\\n\\nHis Twitter: https://twitter.com/digitaldutta\\n\\nRecently he published an article on NRC-NPR-Aadhaar nexus on thewire.in.

His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan\\n\\n> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.\\n> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”\\n> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.\\n\\n> On 8 November 2019, Taseer\\'s Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to \"conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin\". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn\\'t give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled \"India’s divider in chief\" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer\\'s citizenship.\\n\\n> Taseer\\'s first book Stranger to History: A Son\\'s Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a \"must-read\" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world.

One opened near where I lived at the time. I was an engineering student at a decent Bombay college and before the semester exams, I’d be studying at home. My mom would force me to mop the floors and do the dishes. Youth makes most rebel against order and I did too. I told my mom that I’d rather mop the floors at the nearby McDonald’s branch and be paid rather than do the same work at home for no pay. She reluctantly let me try my luck but didn’t have high hopes.\\n\\nI proved her wrong and was quite smug about it. All I did was to walk into the store a week after it opened, ask for the manager and explained that I was looking for a job. He sat me down, explained the terms and did the expected song and dance. I left my phone number with him and lo and behold, he called the next morning asking when I could begin. I began the following morning.\\n\\nMy tasks consisted of doing anything at the store with two exceptions: I could not operate the fryer as you first had to pass a course and I could not do deliveries as I did not have a two-wheeler license. Anything else was fair game and I manned the counter, served customers, cleaned toilets, manned the take-out counter and yes, mopped the floor.\\n\\nMy hours were 9 AM – 7 PM and the store opened at 10 AM. The first hour was spent preparing the store for the onslaught of the McDonald’s-craving indian junta many of whom were sinister vegetarians. I say sinister because if these people had their way, they would crucify anyone who ate meat. Since they could not do this, they resorted to making a nuisance of themselves everywhere they went. At home, they thought nothing of abusing the labour of a lower-caste servant and would force said servant to eat and drink from separate utensils. Anything that came into contact with a meat-eater was deemed to have been defiled and must be purified by magic incantations and ritual cleansing with water. These same people once called the police because my family was cooking fish. The irony of eating food at a restaurant that also served chicken was lost on them but that’s partly because they love the gora and anything that the gora sells to them.\\n\\nAnyhow, once the doors opened at 10 AM, the first wave of customers was invariably college students. Decent people but fairly docile. They viewed McDonald’s servings as the quail and manna of the gods and would rarely complain if the food was substandard which it often was. The evening mom crowd, though, was another story.\\n\\n#Half information is a dangerous thing\\n\\nOne Friday evening, I was at the counter when a well-fed gujurati lady walked up with her well-fed son. They ordered a happy meal for the young meatball and a veggie burger and a coke for madam. There is an internet rumour that chains like McDonalds cheat customers on Coca-Cola by including too much ice. This is not entirely true. The reality is that the syrup coming out of the machine is not entirely diluted and the ice is there for two reasons: to keep the drink cold and to add water. The woman was not aware of this and I served her drink with the standard half-cup of ice. She walked away, found a table and took offence almost immediately. To set the scene, lines when McDonalds first opened in the Bombay suburbs were fairly long and they only kept growing through the day. This woman cuts to the front of the line and accuses me of cheating her with the coke. I said that it was standard practice and even offered to replace her drink with another one. She agreed but kept shouting that I was a cheater. Ok.\\n\\nI filled a new cup with the coke syrup from the machine and proceeded to add cold water from the fridge. She started screaming at this point and demanded that I fill the cup with the syrup. I acquiesced. She walked away with a cup of sugary coke syrup. One customer later, she was back and again shouted at me and accused me of cheating. I said that I had done exactly as she has asked to which she replied “is that how you talk to your mother” and flung the contents of the cup at my face.\\n\\nIndians have this disgusting and mistaken belief that if they pay for a service, they own the service staff. Anecdotally, this seems to be prevalent among the upper castes. The manager appeared on the scene because of the commission and sided with the woman. In india, the word of a woman is taken as gospel and the man is automatically the target of the ire of a lynch mob. I was lucky that no violence was involved. At the end of this scene, the front half of my body was a sticky, sugary mess and the woman walked away with a 1000 rupee voucher.\\n\\n#Beggars\\n\\nMcDonalds have a “food slide” between the kitchen and the counters which is essentially an inclined, stainless steel chute with multiple lanes for food. Once placed, anything on the slide must be on a customer’s place within 90 seconds or it would be binned. Perfectly good food would be binned because it was getting cold. I decided to do a good deed and found a clean bag into which I deposited food from the slide. Good burgers, plenty of fries and a smattering of other “food”. Once done for the day, I took this bag outside and began handing its contents out to the beggars on the street. I was soon mobbed by several but had enough food to go around. They seemed grateful but I did not know what was in store.\\n\\nThe next morning, as soon as the shutters were raised, within literally seconds, about 100 beggars began banging on the glass window panes demanding food. The manager was called and Ashutosh was not pleased when it was revealed that I the naive was the culprit. I still gathered the food but I took it to the local church and left it to them to distribute it.\\n\\n#Space hogs\\n\\nAlthough it has chairs and tables, McDonalds is a sit-down restaurant in the same way that Bombay is a world class city. This, however, would not deter our local business men (read thugs and politicians) from trying to hold business meetings in the restaurant. One fine evening during the rush hour, we had a local politician from the Congress show up, demand food and to the surprise of everyone there, actually pay for it. He then took his entourage and demanded that seated customers pay obeisance to him by vacating their tables. This being India, they complied and the man proceeded to have a 4 hour and 26 minute meeting there with a party of 24 people. I know because we kept notes. He paid for a big mac and a portion of fries.\\n\\n#Midnight in Gujarat\\n\\nAnyone who’s lived near Gujjus will know that many, many gujjus who run their own business have a tendency to eat dinner at 10 PM. McDonalds closed at 10 PM according to the signs but 21:54 was when a torrent of pot-bellied gujju uncles with their puffed-poori wives and kids would line up outside the take-away counter. Although the seating area was off-limits and the front door was closed, Ashutosh would not say no to paying customers. To these gujjus, the sliced buns of McDonald’s bread was like the parted waters of the red sea and I was their Moses. I was often stunned at how much these people ate. I’m a skinny person and I could not eat more than two large McDonald’s burgers. I once saw a man eat 4. In 5 minutes. I worry for his arteries and his wife’s hips.\\n\\n#Marathi Manoos and the Sena\\n\\nFish was once served at our restaurant though it was soon taken off the menu after a group of angry nativists protested. They showed up with the constabulary and orange flags, some with snarling tigers on them and demanded that we stop selling fish, which is apparently haram in staunch Maharashtrian circles. Ashutosh caved and the offending Piscean meat was removed. Another time, the cops showed up with booze and demanded food. They did not pay but sat on the seats, drank and laughed like louts. In the land of the poor, the police are the mafia.\\n\\nIn all, my experience with McDonalds was decent. I worked three months including most of my vacation. I worked 12 hours most days and was paid 350 rupees for each day’s work with no overtime. I worked 6 days a week but the restaurant was open all 7 days, 9 AM – 11 PM for staff (customer hours were shorter). I had the distinct advantage of getting in early when the chain was new and had few employees. I also had the advantage of speaking fairly decent English at a time when most employees did not. If you’re considering this as an option to make some money, things may have changed more recently. I would not recommend eating McDonald’s food regularly. Even the church where I would deposit unused food asked that I stop brining any over. They did not like it because it was oily and would not spoil, the latter causing much suspicion about the contents of the food.\\n\\nThese were my stories from my time there. I have several more, if anyone’s interested.

Still, I translated where needed and filled in the blanks.\\n\\nAll the while waifu-to-be was a wee bit nervous with the whole interaction scene, but it turned out to be a lovely evening. They've traveled a long way and I was joking how the roles have reversed in contrast with traditional Indian norms where the prospect groom is expected to visit the bride and her family.\\n \\nMom had seen her photos on my Facebook, but was overly impressed with her skin and hair in person, to the point I had to ask her to tone it down a bit with the awkward complements. My dad and her dad got into conversations around food and a bunch of other stuff. \\n \\nI guess I'm writing this because it's a bit surreal how smooth everything has been. Her folks had zero issues with their daughter dating a gaijin, maybe because they knew where I worked, and my folks are just happy I didn't turn out to be gay (they had suspected so for a while on extremely silly grounds). Had it been an Indian partner, I don't think it would have been this straightforward.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm tired and will crash, but feel free to ask me anything about Japan, work and life there, partners and dating etc.\\n\\nJust want to make a note that we're very low-key, sober and laidback as a couple. She does not look like a dolled up AV model, I do not look like Tom Cruise's Indian cousin, and we're both quite career minded.

This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.\\n\\nIf you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up.

I was a desperate person at that time and didn\\'t think that there is any chance that it will be successful. After writing that post, I unknowingly became the mastermind behind a protest against corrupt college administrators, corrupt police officers and the media which would refuse to listen to us because they were getting money from these corrupt people.\\n\\nThis incident involves the torture and the death of a student caused by the college management, bribing the police and media to keep quiet, several months of protests which bloomed into a state-wide-unrest forcing the politicians to change sides, arrest & imprisonment of the absconding chairman of a college, vice principal, owners etc and finally the reform of the education system of an entire state! And, I was the one who orchestrated the protest which resulted in all of this. I spent every conscious hour of two months of my life working behind this campaign.\\n\\nI dont want to repeat the entire incident, so you can read about the incident in detail in it\\'s well written [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_College_of_Engineering_and_Research_Centre). Make sure to read about the student death controversy and then the police report which is below under different subsection. Also you can go through my old posts in this subreddit like [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) and [this photo](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5niiw4/this_is_not_saudi_arabia_they_are_not_muslims/)\\n\\nI am making this AskMeAnything so that my experience can help people who think \"I am just an ordinary person, I can\\'t change the system, I can\\'t protest against injustice.\" or \"They are rich and corrupt, so there is no way to bring them to justice, so I should better move on with my life and do nothing\" or \"All the problems is due to the current system/government and I can\\'t do anything about it\".\\n\\nI was a no one in this incident. I didn\\'t know the victim. I was not even a student of that college at that time. I was an ex-student. I had no \"benefit\" in doing any of this. Also, I did all of it anonymously. No one except about 5 friends know that I was working behind the scenes. \\n\\nAlso, my major contribution was in directing the protest, contacting the right people, managing the information and running the campaign. I did majority of it by just sitting in a room with a laptop. There were hundreds of other brave people who staged the protest and did the things which I wanted to be done.\\n\\nI didn\\'t start out thinking I will coordinate this protest or spend so much time on it. This all started out when I started a Facebook page asking justice for the victim. I regularly posted new content and people started contacting me with new information or asking me what they should do. Within few days, I was having so much contact with so many people from various backgrounds like students, teachers, reporters, lawyers, ex-students, parents etc that I unknowingly became the one who was running the entire campaign both online and offline.\\n\\nSo many people selflessly helped in finding information. Some law students of other colleges volunteered to write legal notices or other such stuff. Some people traveled great distances to find certain information. Some people had contacts with politicians and was able to mobilize partymen. Some brought in media. Some were reporters who were directly taking content from me and posting it. Some were helping in the creation of the content. And, I had to ensure that the content I was providing is true.\\n\\nAfter about a month of work, it started showing signs of success. We started to get the attention of mainstream media who started posting the full details without censoring anything. Then, few weeks later, this became the headline news of all the newspapers in the state. It became the talk of the town. I overheard so many people discussing about this incident while travelling in trains or buses.\\n\\nThen, student protests broke out at many private colleges across the state demanding student unions and fighting against injustices. Few colleges even lost their affiliation and closed down due to this incident. And, students of one such engineering college was transferred to better colleges. My friends and relatives at several other colleges said that the situation has improved after this incident.\\n', 'https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9duvkq/i_am_ceo_of_drona_aviation_startup_of_nanodrone/\\n\\n> I am IIT Bombay alumni.

I returned to India roughly 20 years ago. I had fully settled in to India. I didn\\'t quite miss anything from the middle east barring the food and stable electricity :P \\n\\nI had a choice to make about 10 years ago, to move out of India and I chose not to. Mostly because my friend circle, my gf, and most of my family was in India at the time. I found a job in a great company that kickstarted my career fairly well. \\n\\n\\nDue in part to my own existential crisis, due in part to a change in outlook around 6 years ago(post MBA) and due in part to everything that has been happening in the country for the last few years, I gradually started finding living in the country to be unbearable. This is not an anti-BJP post by any means. I\\'ve never been political and I do not see myself ever being. I do have ideologies which at the very core is \"Live and let live\"....or to be blunt....Unfortunately and I\\'m sure a lot of you agree, the Indian society simply isn\\'t going to let you do that. Its not that I was living a loud/flamboyant life. Its that even the simple life I tried to live was being threatened in several ways. \\n\\nThis group, r/india though often negative in tone has also helped open my eyes to a lot of things. This discourse is important, if for nothing else, as an outlet for folks who are frustrated. For folks to empathize and sympathize.\\n\\nAt this point, we begin a change in tone...........\\n\\nI saw my friends, colleagues and classmates gradually all leave the country. Some of them left around 8-10 years ago. None of them show a genuine interest in returning. But this didn\\'t really bother me. I still had a great friends circle and I\\'ve always been exceptionally great and keeping in touch with my friends and meeting them every chance I get. Nothing was changing my mind that I needed to move out. \\n\\nBut one day, something just snapped. I spoke to a friend of mine over dinner. She was a classmate from college. She had been working with a firm in Australia. See the thing is, she and I never spoke in college but we just knew each other. I saw on fb that she was in town, we got chatting and decided to meet up. She was asking why I don\\'t look for opportunities abroad. I said I never felt that things are necessarily that much better there. She said she could potentially find me a job. \\n\\nI found out that she and I were in similar industries. She was earning(post-conversion) around 60L more than me. I told her that really doesn\\'t matter given living costs. She told me she \\'saves\\' roughly 20 LPA. And believe me, she\\'s not someone who tries to save. This was a time when I was commuting about 90 minutes one way to work. 8km. She travels 20 minutes to work and can afford to stay away from the central/expensive parts of the city due to great public transport. \\n\\nShe lives a healthy and fun life. Has co-workers who know to stick to their boundaries. Has no one bother her about what she wears, who she\\'s with, what she eats etc. I couldn\\'t find a single objective measure, to counter her with. \\n\\nI made it my life\\'s mission to find out for myself whether this was all truly the case. So I started looking out. Thankfully, my wife was offered a perfectly timed transfer to a western country for 2 years and that came with a Visa for me as well. And so I took the leap. Found myself a job before I landed here. \\n\\nIts been a few months now and I\\'ve finally seen what this other side is like today.

Now the missing link in the story was how did Ajit Pawar was able to get this letter when NCP was about to give support to Shivsena.\\n\\nThe reason behind this is, NCP prepared 4 letters in total. 1 was to provide support to ShivSena. 1 was to provide support to Congress. 1 was to claim the support of other parties to form their own government and the last one was to provide support to BJP. All these letters were with Ajit Pawar as he was the leader of NCP. Fadnavis Blackmailed Ajit Pawar on Friday Midnight which forced him to give this letter to Fadnavis and allowed him to form the government. Sharad Pawar is well aware of this as just a day before he was with Mr. Modi to talk about 'Farmers'. The situation became comical as Shiv Sena wasn't aware of this 4 letters existing and thus to save face, the 'letter was forged' argument is created.\\n\\nAlso, AMA I guess.\", 'I am the Managing Editor of The Ken.

I\\'m learning and growing *every day* as much as (if not more than) you or anyone else in here and this learning is meant to be an infinite journey, be it for you or for me or for anyone else. Two: I will try to answer all questions, except for questions to which I quite frankly have *no answers to*. There are plenty of areas within the human experience that I have little to no experience with, and I\\'ll *not* talk about things I don\\'t know jackshit about because hypocrisy/fakery isn\\'t my branch of expertise. Three: And this is the most important thing. Please do not take my words as gospel just because I\\'m \"woke\" - for what I have to offer is but a different perspective than what you may have considered before. Use your own discernment, logic, intuition and experimentation to see what works for you and what doesn\\'t. Even if you think that I\\'m a complete fake, all I ask is that you at least read what I have to say with an open mind, take what works for you and trash what doesn\\'t. Because as right or wrong as I could be, no two people have the same paths towards attaining spiritual awakening. So, even if what I have to offer in terms of an advice is appropriate for, say, 10 out of 100 people; there are still always going to be 90 others who will find no relevance in my words. That does not necessarily mean that I\\'m being a fraudulent cunt, it would just mean that 90 others have different ways of going about things, which is a *perfectly valid thing*.\\n\\n**Why *Is* AMA?**  \\n\\nHumanity as a whole is headed towards some pretty fucking challenging times ahead and some truly unpleasant and shattering revelations about the nature of the reality that they are living in. A lot of those challenging situations are already presenting themselves in every way even at personal levels, just look at all of the fear, negativity, sadness and depression in any of the Reddit threads; or anywhere else on the internet for that matter. The internet is just a smaller reflection of the greater reality and planetary consciousness. And then, there are all of these changes that are also now rapidly taking place across people\\'s lives, and will shortly be taking place across national, global and even greater scales than that. All I wish to do here is to assist anyone going through troubled times (who is at least willing to listen to a fresh perspective) because it would honestly be such a waste if I knew all of these cool things and was ultimately unable to help anyone when they truly needed it. Not happening on my watch.  \\n\\nThank you for your time.  \\n\\n**P.S.** Even after this AMA is over, I\\'ll be there to assist any of you who are at all interested in the same through the direct messaging feature. Hope that helps.  \\n\\n**EDIT 1:** Please keep asking questions even though seeing my replies may take some time; mainly because I tend to write really long-ass replies. I prefer to be really comprehensive about this, hope you\\'ll understand.  \\n\\n**EDIT 2:** For all those who are interested in knowing more about what happens after death and things such as how \"soul contracts\" that we make prior to incarnation upon this planet work, you are most welcome to visit the [\"Exceptional Experiences\" section (link)](http://www.nderf.org/Archives/exceptional.html) of the NDERF (Near Death Experience Research Foundation) experience contribution repository.

The walk is a project of the Veditum India Foundation, and is being undertaken independently by me. A team from our production partner Digital Nerve comprising of Ayan Sil and Rahul Mitra are filming a documentary and capturing photographs. Ardra Venugopal, a Veditum fellow is working on cross sector research in relation to the river and the people living alongside it. We are recording real life experiences of people and the vivid sounds of nature, documenting success stories and that of distress related to the river, collecting social & scientific data and bringing out a first person narrative of the river as a co-living entity, if not the protagonist that it is. The idea is to use research in vivid ways to capture the attention of the audience and speak to them of the state of affairs, not just qualitatively but quantitatively as well. The project provides a platform to collect data for environmental research being conducted across the nation in various institutes.\\n\\n\\nWe are walking along this route [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1fBlKd3W5vPbbwgH0G6TDK604kSw]\\n\\n\\nIn the past, i have had the opportunity to cycle from Calcutta to Mumbai (2500kms), working on issues of Child Labour, Child Education and Micro Lending with CRY and Rang De.

We'll soon be going live with a second round of crowdfunding, since the first round didn’t reach our target and use that to support the Moving Upstream series of projects, which is soon going to witness an expansion. This includes an opportunity for more young people to undergo river journeys with the support of Veditum India Foundation, to help us understand, visualize and thereby improve the situation at the grassroots. \\n\\nProof: https://twitter.com/sidagarwal/status/784068473903120384\\n\\nFeel free to mail me your ideas, comments and feedback on contact@veditum.org .

Link: https://redd.it/3ya52q\\n\\n---\\n\\nGreetings /r/India,\\n\\nPlease find the details of the AMA below.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Bio:\\n\\n[Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chdaniels) has a BSE in Mechanical Engineering from Duke University and an MBA from Duke University - The Fuqua School of Business. Prior to working as the Vice President, Product of Internet.Org  he has worked at various positions at Facebook, Microsoft, Applied Semantics, Inc., OneWest.net and Lehman Brothers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Date & Time:\\n\\nDecember 26, Saturday 6 PM to 7 PM IST\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Verification: \\n\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hImJW1v.jpg\\n\\n---\\n\\nPlease thank /u/Kunalb11 (Kunal Shah, founder of Freecharge) and /u/wordswithmagic for setting up this AMA.', 'Hello All,  \\nThis is Urjit Yajnik, Physics Professor, but also the unenviable erstwhile Dean of Student Affairs, IIT Bombay from roughly during 2011 to 2015, a position fondly or otherwise called DoSA.  \\n\\nHere is the [proof](https://i.imgur.com/bMcINPp.png).\\n\\nI have agreed to do AMA with due encouragement and prodding by [InsIghT](https://www.facebook.com/insight.iitbombay), our own loveable if noisome media body. And they have offered to stand by me through this session, as much as media stand by officials, I guess.\\n\\nLet me set the ball rolling by what is on my mind as I face the large general body of people but majority of whom are most likely the sufferers of my \"regime\". I am opening up in this particular session to questions that are related to   \\n\\n* Matters pertaining to IIT Bombay; more generally to the IIT system  \\n* Higher technological education, in India and worldwide  \\n* General issues about career choices, future of the relationship between technology and society and what, with my limited crystal ball gazing abilities, may be your available strategies to navigate that.  \\n\\nTo kick off, let me make three points :  \\n\\n1. What was my abiding motto for handing the DoSA job? It was that students of IIT Bombay and of a campus and academic environment similar to IIT Bombay should live in a self-governed, participatory environment. As you know we have no resident wardens in individual hostels, though the faculty Wardens are only a stone’s throw away. I relied mostly on the fact that students have a responsibility to their own lives and those of\\ntheir fellow residents of the campus. And I received ample justification to this belief, in the initiatives and tasks that student representatives or individuals took up, sometimes for the larger student body but often also just for that individual who needed help the most. \\n\\n2. IIT Bombay is at present blazing a trail. From the exposure to faculty research output, to the inspiration and infrastructure they receive from IIT Bombay, students and alumni have made the most to put the Institute in the forefront. A large number of alumni and well wishers have also devoted substantial amounts of time and resources to make this happen. We see the culture of fundamental contributions to technology, to management and innovation, as well as to entrepreneurship to grow in the time to come.\\n\\n3. Career choices. As the world becomes both information loaded and also small in terms of the rapidity and reach of ideas and products, it becomes a challenge to decide how to steer and navigate through this environment. So long as you navigate yourself ethically and are making a definite contribution to the  larger good, you are fine.\\n\\nWell, so those are the thoughts with which I start. Now let\\'s AMA away!\\n\\n\\n**[Volunteer\\'s note: Prof. Yajnik will start answering questions at around 9.30 pm. Feel free to post your questions till then]**\\n\\n**EDIT:** The AMA is now done. Prof. Yajnik spent about five hours on this, answering 50 questions. Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as we did :D', \"We're live on Periscope https://www.periscope.tv/HoeZaay/\\n\\nand \\n\\nLive on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/Hoezaay/\", 'I am a PhD students working on Gravitational Waves.

I will provide verifications to them.\\n\\nYou can visit this website to know more: http://gw.iucaa.in/\\n\\n', \"Hello, r/india!\\n\\nThis AMA is on behalf of my grandfather. A few days ago [I posted](http://imgur.com/a/rQ210) pictures of his pre-Independence British Passport that was issued to him when he had to travel to the Middle East in early 1947. The post generated a lot of interest and people had questions for him and requested an AMA.\\n\\nI've frequently talked to him about his experiences and he has told me bits and pieces over the years. It's really fascinating to listen to because it was a completely-different time, and it's amazing listening to someone who actually lived through those times.\\n\\nMy grandfather is 93 years old. He went to UC College in Aluva, but didn't finish his degree, instead deciding to run away and join the military. He took a train from Chennai to Lahore for basic training, and then went to Bombay for a Wireless Operators Course. After that he spent a few months in Hyderabad where he was promoted to Sergeant. \\n\\nHe was then posted to Ramree Island off the coast of Burma with the 4th squadron of the Royal Indian Air force to help them conduct recce operations against the Imperial Japanese Army. After the end of the war he was offered a chance to be part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, but instead opted to leave the military.\\n\\nHe worked for Kodak for a bit and then was offered a job with the Iraq Petroleum Company, which he took. This was when he was issued his passport. \\n\\nBecause of his age and because he recently had some surgery he gets easily tired and I don't want to exert him too much. As a result he won't be able to answer your questions immediately. But please do post them and I will start going over them tomorrow morning and will transcribe his answers. Also, there are some details he can't remember so I apologize in advance if he is not able to answer some of your questions.\\n\\n[Ask him anything!](http://imgur.com/0m8sek0)\\n\\nAlso, [proof](http://imgur.com/J6yEqca).\\n\\n**EDIT**: It is **9:00 AM** IST right now. My grandpa let me know that he has a doctor's appointment, but we should be back by around **10:15 AM** IST or so to answer the rest of the questions. Sorry for the delay, but he is still very interested in answering the questions! \\n\\n**UPDATE 1**: My grandpa is back!\\n\\n**UPDATE 2**: Taking a break for lunch - will come back after.\\n\\n**UPDATE 3**: Back after lunch and I've transcribed his responses to all of the other remaining questions. I'm finishing up now because my grandfather is getting tired (he's already coughing a little bit after talking so much). I'm sorry if we were unable to answer all your questions! My grandfather thanks you all and I want to thank the r/india mods for helping me organize this AMA and the r/india community for making it a success. I've wanted to collect his thoughts and experiences from those years and this AMA really helped me do that well. Thank you all again!\", '', 'In the light of recent events, I have 3 questions.\\n\\n1) What is your policy on sexual harassment?
