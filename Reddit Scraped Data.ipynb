* Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub\\n * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze\\n * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell\\n * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell\\n* Don't\\n * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean\\n\\n#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)\\n^If ^youâ€™re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^thatâ€™s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^youâ€™ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.\\n\\n^Itâ€™s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.\\n\\n1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you donâ€™t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless itâ€™s absolutely essential. Donâ€™t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\\n\\n2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people â€” in your home, or in a car, because youâ€™re on your way to see a doctor (and only after youâ€™ve called first) â€” wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\\n\\n3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you havenâ€™t just washed them.\\n\\n4. **DISINFECTING**: Donâ€™t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\\n\\n5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if youâ€™re touching anything that might carry the patientâ€™s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\\n\\n#####Share your Idle CPU/GPU Power towards find solutions for Covid-19\\n\\n&gt;Do you have a CPU/GPU sitting at home, not doing anything?

India confirmed its highest ever daily number of infections at 1,035 over the past 24 hours, health ministry officials said. This brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus patients to nearly 7,500. Of those, 642 have recovered, and 239 have died.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi engaged in a four-hour dialogue with chief ministers of Indian states on Saturday to discuss whether to lift the lockdown, which has caused extreme hardships to Indiaâ€™s hundreds of millions of casual and informal sector workers, whose incomes have collapsed since the restrictive measures were introduced on March 22.  Mr Modi made no official statement or comment after the meeting concluded. But Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of New Delhi, made it clear that the lockdown would not be lifted on April 14, when it is currently due to expire. Mr Modi is expected to address the nation on Sunday or Monday night about the extension.  Analysts and industries expect that Mr Modi may announce some relaxation of the restrictions for farmers, who are poised to harvest their annual winter wheat crop. Industrial businesses, especially exporters, are also hoping for some relaxation for manufacturers so they can maintain the supply of essential items, and fulfil international orders.  However, all Indiaâ€™s public transportation systems -- including urban metros rails, the railway network, and all domestic and international passenger flights -- are likely to remain suspended.  \\n\\n\\nSource: Financial Times\\n\\n[https://www.ft.com/content/6f64d280-6a46-3117-a2ea-a5cd76b91683](https://www.ft.com/content/6f64d280-6a46-3117-a2ea-a5cd76b91683)', \"My friend posted this on his LinkedIn\\n\\n>Testing capacity in India can be increased by up to factor 10 to up to 400,000 a day (!) by doing pooled testing.
