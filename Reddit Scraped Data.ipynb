You have no business breeding if you enjoyed this massive piece of trash.  In fact, your internet privileges should be taken away, since you morons have rated this fecal matter 9.3 on IMDB.  Do you chumps actually understand what \"acting\" means?  Making huge bulgy eyes and exaggerated reactions to any goddamn event, and having the camera move to your face to show your reaction to everything does NOT qualify as good film-making or acting.  Those saas/bahu TV serials have better acting and facial expressions! Crazy feats by the hero are a staple of almost all action movies - but this movie took it to a complete nonsensical extreme (one guy stopping an entire goddamn statue from tipping over).\\nI won\\'t even go into the \"start molesting the girl and she\\'ll like you\" romance subplot - I\\'ve seen fucking Hentai\\'s that have better character relationships.\\n\\nHonestly, the frustrating thing is that India is capable of releasing great cinema.  Company by RGV is my favorite Indian movie.  Black Friday, Satya, Ab Tak Chappan, Taare Zameen Par, Delhi Belly, Kahaani are all excellent.  There are plenty others which are at the very least competent - Sarkar 1/2, Sarfarosh, etc...\\n\\nBut this Baahubali shit... man..I\\'m dead serious when I say if the Indian public thinks that this is fine film-making - we deserve to be wiped out of existence.  It isn\\'t a poverty thing either - I was at a theatre in the US - and plenty of absolute retards were clapping and whooping at the shitty dialogue and the \"romance\".  \\n\\nI grew up in India watching plenty of cheesy 80s/90s Hindi movies - and enjoyed many as a kid, and plenty as an adult.  But Baahubali was so far above and beyond in sheer stupidity that I weep for our civilization.  This movie is going to be held up as a \"shining\" example of Indian cinema... I feel like stabbing people in their faces.\\n\\n------\\nEDIT - since I see people making \"you like chocolate and I like vanilla ice cream\" type posts, I\\'ll preempt those here - \\n\\nReasonable people can have different tastes. However that logic only extends to a certain point. No matter how \"artistic\" you think your spray of diarrhea on your toilet is, it will never be \"better\" than a painting like the Mona Lisa. You are simply wrong and unreasonable if you find your shit to be \"better\" art than the Mona Lisa. Some things are objectively worse than others - period. Baahubali in this case is objectively inferior to almost any other movie ever made.\\n', 'I recently wrapped up a trip to India (I did the Golden Triangle). My favorite thing about my trip to India was how much it made me appreciate that I don\\'t live in India. \\n\\nBefore arriving in Delhi I did research and booked a two-night hotel stay ahead of time. Upon arrival I went to an \\'official\\' taxi stand at the Delhi airport to get a ride to the hotel. It was 02:00 and my traveling partner and I were both exhausted from the flight. The taxi driver began driving us to our hotel and then gave us a story about how the roads were closed due to political violence. He told us that unfortunately he wouldn\\'t be able to bring us to our hotel due to the road closures. He then brought us to a \\'tourism agency\\' and a desk agent proceeded to make fake phone calls to his friend who pretended to be working at my real hotel. The desk agent told me they would have to make alternative sleeping arrangements for us for our own safety. After making me feel bad and then demanding payment for making him wait (what a nice guy, right?), my taxi driver brought us to a very seedy hotel. The front desk agents at the hotel refused to give us wifi access lest we figure out that we had been abducted/kidnapped. Unfortunately, I was too tired and unaware of my surroundings to challenge or question the scam. Looking back I realize that we were essentially abducted. The next day my hotel emailed me and asked why we never showed up. When I emailed them back to explain what happened they weren\\'t even surprised. This was just the first day.\\n\\nThe rest of my trip was a relentless series of scams and harassments. I never got scammed again thanks to the wonderful education I received on the first night. But I have to say, it was exhausting and made it difficult to simply walk around. Small packs of Indian teen males dressed like homoerotic cowboys droned around treating me like I was fucking Justin Bieber. Many of them asking me for selfies and then taking pictures of me anyway when I declined their request.\\n\\nThen we took a train to Agra. I had become intimate with the filth, dirt and pollution in Delhi up to this point. The massive piles of trash, dirt and feces; ungodly smells that have permanently permeated my subconscience. I spent the next few hours on the train watching no less than a thousand of people taking shits on the train tracks. The train-shitting will be permanently etched into my memory for all of time.\\n\\nAround this time I came down with travelers diarrhea. Most likely from some shit that I ate because of improper food handling. Or maybe I got it from the shit I drank because the water in India is all contaminated. Regardless of how I got it, I spent the next 5 days shackled to my hotel room because I couldn\\'t stop explosively shitting out diarrhea. \\n\\nFinally I began to feel better and decided to go see the Taj Mahal. After dodging scam attempts, getting harassed and heckled I eventually made it. After taking some videos of the Taj Mahal with my camera I soon found myself surrounded by a pack of men, including an Army officer with a machine gun. They then berated me for taking pictures and videos of the Taj while hundreds of other people around us took pictures and videos with their cameras and phones. I asked the men and the army officer why hundreds of other people were allowed to film. The answer to this question will probably accompany me to my grave. I was then harassed by these same men who wouldn\\'t leave me alone until I checked my camera into a locker. \\n\\nIt was at this point that I decided that I would be engaging in masochism if I continued my trip. So I left.\\n\\nMy takeaways:\\n+ The filth, dirt, garbage, feces and smell are such a massive problem that they can\\'t be ignored. Egypt, Palestine and Jordan seemed like a swiss mountain retreat compared to the stuff I saw in India. + The scamming, harassing and heckling was non-stop and exhausting. + I have never seen such a wanton disregard/outright hostility of people toward their own environment. + The expression: \"Don\\'t shit where you eat\" never resonated with me more than when I was walking around India. + It amazed me that India is on the same planet as the other countries around the world that I\\'ve visited.\\n\\nIn short: thank you India for giving me perspective and appreciation for the things I have in my life. For the loving people who don\\'t judge me or tell me who I can/cannot marry. For the people who don\\'t judge me for not believing in God. For the faucet that gives me clean drinking water and the food that nourishes my body. Thank you India, for reminding me that I live in a place where people even have the luxury to care about the planet we all share together. For all of you struggling to make a better India, I send you my love and wish you the best of luck in the struggle. For those of you who continue the status quo without any consideration or thought: may god have mercy on your soul.\\n ', \"Am watching the news now. I had no idea she was so full of shit.

We see that people of all castes, creeds and religions are going about their normal lives without any obstruction from anybody. Since Modi government got elected, no changes have been made to any laws related to social matters. Then why is the media 'manufacturing' these stories of so called intolerance? Why is the media laying the blame at Modi's doorsteps for crimes that are taking place in states ruled by 'secular' parties like Cong (Kar) and SP (UP) ?

First a little bit about myself. I am a Bengali woman based out of Mumbai and am a mother of 2 lovely kids. My husband too is a Bengali. What I will detail below are what I’ve heard and gathered over the years from my Bengali girl friends, colleagues, relatives and acquaintances over the course of many years.\\n\\nFirst a few points about marriage itself. One, marriage isn’t just about two individuals finding heart to heart connect. Humans are social animals and its said that no individual is an island. So deciding to marry any person isn’t just about the person and you, it’s also about your family and his family (at the very least) and also about the wider society itself. Taking the view that marriage is only about two individuals is selfish and such marriages die a natural death, with deleterious consequences to both parties, in the course of time.\\n\\nAllow me first to digress a bit and try and answer as to what makes Bengali women so wanted and desirable. First, they are truly equal to males what with their parents never having discriminated against them in their upbringing on the basis of their gender. Second, they are well qualified and with their smarts, poise and confidence get well earning jobs. Third, they are considered “hot” and therefore desirable by other Indian men. Fourth, they are trusting and liberal, which is often taken advantage off, and last but not the least, they are money foolish. It is a proverb that a fool and his money are soon separated and Bengalis fit this description to a T. When Bengali women fall for cheats such as below its but natural that their dumbed down money instincts, coupled with their liberalism, can be a poisonous concoction that leads to financial ruin. Look no further than what has allegedly been done to Bengali women just on the fake promise of marriage. 'Tax man' duped women of Rs70 lakh on matrimonial sites - Times of India. If Bengalis can lose money merely on the promise of marriage it doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes do infer that the Bengali and her money will soon be parted in a closer relationship, such as marriage, if she isn’t careful.\\n\\n**How do Bengali non-Bengali marriages impact Bengali families economically?**\\n\\nIt is often seen that Bengali girls, despite being given a liberal upbringing and good education, choose to marry partners from downright misogynistic and patriarchal cultures. These are the people with the problems of female foeticide in their societies. When a Bengali girl marries a non-Bengali, the entire past, present and future life of the Bengalis are impacted. Bengali society by spending money on the education of their daughters and thereby creating an economically independent entity are in a way subsidizing non-Bengali societies, who in a economic sense “profited” by commiting female foeticide. Secondly in the present, the entire resources generated by the Bengali girl and her savings are appropriated and used by the non-Bengali society. Thirdly, after the death of her parents, it is seen that the Bengali girl invariably litigates for paternal property. Note that Punjabis and Banias, who have a strong Delhi connection have better access to lawyers who can get justice at the Supreme Court. As an example, gentle reader, you are referred to the following Supreme Court judgment (Civil Appeal No 4646 of 2006)\\n\\n(edit : link removed; just search in google for Civil Appeal No 4646 of 2006)\\n\\nSo in a way the Bengali father is working his entire life for the betterment of non-Bengali society.\\n\\n\\n**Dowry**\\n\\nA point that is often missed is that love marriage is not a dowry free marriage. The dowry system in non-Bengali cultures is systemic and deeply entrenched in different aspects of their cultures. Bengalis often think that since there is no upfront demand of money the marriage is dowry free. However that is not so. In the long run the Bengali father will end up giving more dowry over the lifetime of his daughter’s marriage. In addition after his death his son will be expected to take over and continue giving the dowry. How does this system work. Non-Bengali cultures ask for expensive gifts like gold, diamonds, even cash, clothes (for all relatives) for various ceremonies after marriage. Thus there will be ceremonies after say 30 days of marriage, 45 days of marriage, 6 months of marriage, 1 year of marriage, which have no equivalent in Bengali culture in which the girl’s father is expected to give gifts. Often times these are done on the pretext of pujas. In addition marriage ceremonies are often elaborate and the non-Bengali side often demands that Bengali families pony up money for that. This can be upto 4–5 lakhs conservatively. In addition since non-Bengalis usually have lots of relatives then it’s expected that gifts be given to a large number of relatives, maybe upto 50 people. One can easily calculate expenditure for that. On atleast two specific occasions, i.e. baby showers and right after birth of children, the girls parents are expected to send gifts and money to the non-Bengali inlaws and relatives. Expenditure for the baby shower is atleast 1 to 1 and half lakhs and after birth of each child it is expected that Bengali parents will send gifts to inlaws, son-in-law and baby, the expenditure for which is not less than 2–3 lakhs for each child. In addition non-Bengali families expect gifts on the occasions of festivals such as Diwali etc. If the Bengali father refuses then obviously the working Bengali girl will pay these from her savings. This is dowry plain and simple. Similarly non-Bengalis give gifts to their sisters on these occasions and the Bengali girls often times spend their and their Bengali parents’ life savings on the marriage ceremonies of their husband’s sisters. This too is dowry as money is being extorted from Bengalis on the relationship formed through marriage. The Indian courts accept all of the above examples as valid instances of dowry harassment.\\n\\n**Diet**\\n\\nOne point that is not given enough importance in Bengali girl non-Bengali men marriages is the issue of diet. I advise gentle readers to read the following National Geographic article on diet and how the diet of our ancestors is key to our sustained health and wellness.\\n\\nThe Evolution of Diet\\n\\nIf Bengali girl is put in a situation where she can’t eat fish and meat then it will impact her health. How one may ask? See meat/fish is harder to digest so it stays in the system longer and makes people feel fuller longer. Therefore people don’t binge eat processed foods like chips, biscuits etc thereby keeping weight in control. It is often seen that Bengali girls moving to a vegetarian diet after marriage put on weight as they have to eat more to feel full. This gives rise to various health problems such as hypertension, diabetes and even cancer. So the best food for an ethnic Bengali is the diet of her ancestors, that is maach, bhaat, pulses and gourds.\\n\\nOk, getting back to the main question at hand. I will classify non-Bengali men based on their backgrounds and try and provide guidance on the the question asked.\\n\\n***North Indian Men, mainly from UP, Bihar, MP (mainly Hindi speakers)***\\n\\nThese people are parochial and don’t have much love for either Bengalis or Bengali culture. In fact due to linguistic pride they positively feel superior to Bengalis and seek to put them down. These are also the folks with dowry/dowry death/domestic violence problems in their own community. See the case of north Indian political leader of anti-corruption party based out of Delhi married to Bengali wife.\\n\\nI might also add here almost everyone in this category has a relative or two in politics. Now, dear Bengali lass, you may see this as an advantage. However think about the following. Social interactions demand give and take. I know of a Bengali lady MBA, from a premier institute in India, who married her classmate who belongs to this category of people. Both husband and wife are in corporate jobs. However the non-Bengali man has politicians as relatives and they have pressured the couple to be their benami for illegally acquired wealth. This is because at the husband’s family level it was felt that this couple was best placed to hide/invest their wealth as they could explain that it was theirs. However this didn’t fly with the income tax department and last checked there were prosecutions against the couple for wealth beyond their means. Also note that most politics in India, at all levels, is accompanied by court cases etc. I know of Bengali lady, a software engineer working in a well known Indian company, who was forced to stand surety in court for a relative of her non-Bengali husband of this category. This person then absconded from court proceedings and the poor Bengali girl had to face the ignominy of being jailed for few days for having stood false surety.\\n\\n**North India Hindu Punjabis/North India Banias/Gujrati Patels/Jains/Marwaris**\\n\\nThis is a category different from the one above. They don’t display any overt hatred towards Bengalis or Bengali people but they are very money minded. Since they don’t display any overt hatred Bengali girls are often drawn towards these people. However the reasons why these people want to approach Bengali girls is not always love and altruism. Recall that Bengalis are well educated with good jobs. A good many of the above category of boys have startup dreams nowadays and expect their wives (and their wives parents) to seed fund their ideas and for the Bengali wife to earn while they take risks. That only 1 out of 7 start ups succeed is a cold statistic that is true in India as it is true in the rest of the world. Bengalis being liberal minded, especially Bengali parents with only one daughter may be more likely to pony up money for the non Bengali son-in-law’s startup dreams. The point here is that if a Bengali father has a net worth of 1 crore he may be convinced to give upto 50 lakhs for his non Bengali son-in-law’s startup dreams. Were the same non Bengali son-in-law married inside his community, his caste father-in-law would only have given him 25 lakhs (out of his networth of 10 crores). As stated earlier Bengalis are fools with respect to money and girls should see if there are any warning signs that they will ever be exploited.\\n\\nI might also point out that today a substantial number of Bengali girls get married to the boys of this category. So large is the trend that were these boys Muslims, the Hindutvadis would have labeled it as love jihad. However Bengalis don’t think in this way.\\n\\nLastly, there is the important point of diet. A vast majority of these folks are vegetarian.\\n\\nThe other major point is that in these families the finances of the family members is often controlled by an elder male, usually the father-in-law or even the father-in-law’s elder brother. Everybody is expected to turn over the finances to the control of this gentleman. The sons do so and their wives, irrespective of background are also expected to do the same.\\n\\nOne special point I’ve noticed amongst this set is that Bengali girls with business qualifications such as MBA, CA, CS, ACMA, Actuary are in high demand and affairs with non-Bengali men start during the course of professional study itself.\\n\\n**Special point**\\n\\nOne thing that is seen with most north Indian men is that they project more that what they are, be it in terms of wealth, accomplishment, family status and most importantly earning capacity. They may have some business/companies also but their earnings will be minimal and they are actually looking to live off the earnings of the wife. Most Bengalis are from service class and take things at face value and get fooled. See the case of north Indian political leader of anti-corruption party based out of Delhi married to Bengali wife.\\n\\nOne another point is the celebration of Holi in North Indian families. Usually the ladies stay in the house and the relatives come to celebrate at home. This is a festival wherein touching and hugging may be to the extent that the non-North Indian wife may feel uncomfortable especially if the male persons doing so belong to a different generation.\\n\\nA third point is that people of this category often engage in side businesses to supplement their income. They expect their wives also to engage and be part of this business. This could be anything like Amway, selling insurance, stocks, mutual funds, or even home made crafts, drawings, soaps etc. Bengali women who often have some training in arts and crafts, which their Bengali families trained them in as a hobby, may be particularly vulnerable and under pressure at non Bengali households to commercialize their knowledge. So Bengali woman will be expected to earn in office, do their full quota of housework and child rearing and also engage in side business of selling Amway or crafts. It is not that the incomes from these are fabulous. Yes, everyone desires extra money and income. However Bengalis have solved the problem differently by working hard to get good education so that they can get better paying jobs and not have to do this side income business.\\n\\n**Muslim boys, both Bengali and non-Bengali.**\\n\\nA certain set (not all) of these types actually consider it their bounden duty to convert Kafir girls to Islam. That’s their only objective. Be wary of this type. Typically their misogyny will give them away.\\n\\n**Tam Brahms (also most other South Indian Brahmins)**\\n\\nThis set is most akin to Bengalis, in terms of love for culture, literature, music etc. barring diet. However be prepared to bear with an overbearing attitude and a “I-m-so-superior” attitude and a “preferred” way to do things. If you can tolerate this then go ahead. In addition these people, and in fact most non-Bengali men, are far more money minded then Bengali men.\\n\\n**Non Brahmin South Indians**\\n\\nThere’s nothing in particular to not recommend them. However a lot of these people are quite flexible with their faith. At the time of marriage the boy may be Hindu but after some time he may convert to Christianity. Also most of these people have one branch of their family which is Christian. I know of a Bengali lady lecturer who married a Telugu gentleman. At the time of marriage the gentleman was Hindu. About 10 years ago the gentleman converted to Christianity and became a Christian preacher. His Bengali wife also became a Christian and co preacher and they now have their own ministry in Andhra.\\n\\n**Keralite men**\\n\\nWith a heavy dose of communism, these people may share some of the liberal ideals of the Bengali. However be warned about chettan’s love for beef parotta and liquor and that he and his Malayali male friends will love to gather for binge drinking sessions. A last point about South Indian men, and it applies across caste and religion, is that they are thrifty spenders and the Bengali’s innate liberalism may be appalled at the penny pinching ways of these people.\\n\\n**Marathi men**\\n\\nI stay in Mumbai and have been to my fair share of Marathi boy, Bengali girl marriages. In 100% percent of the cases I’ve noticed that the marriage was conducted only as per Marathi culture. While in marriages with other non-Bengalis a few or even the entire marriage happens as per Bengali customs, in Marathi-Bengali marriages the marriage is always as per Marathi culture. Marathis don’t really have any strong opinions about Bengalis but are vigilant about their culture at their times.\\n\\n**Foreigners/White men.**\\n\\nWhite men, may not be able to differentiate between Bengali women and non-Bengali women but there are often some wrong reasons as to why foreign men look for Indian women. Chief among them is that they want to marry somebody to whom they can always feel superior. This is an inbuilt and unconscious racism in their psyche. The Bengali or Indian wife is essentially a maid, albeit a well treated one.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince the writing of this answer I’ve been asked if there are other observations that I’d like to share on Bengali non-Bengali marriages.\\n\\nSo in no particular order of things here are some of my observations.\\n\\nAbout 50% of the Bengali girls who come from WB or north eastern states to metros such as Delhi-NCR/Mumbai/Bangalore marry non Bengalis. About 10% of Bengali boys too do so.\\n99.99% of Bengali women whose fathers migrated to the above mentioned metros and who have had a substantial period of stay outside WB marry non-Bengalis. About 25% of Bengali men also do so.\\nIn the past 5 years or so about 25% to 35% of Bengali girls in WB too are married to non-Bengali men.\\nIn the first year after marriage Bengali girls married to non-Bengalis will invariably turn up at the local Durga Puja pandal, non-Bengali hubby in tow for sindur khela. This decreases as time passes and later it’s all about Karwa Chauth and Diwali and Durga Puja is given a pass.\\n\\nBengali girls marrying Bengalis, irrespective of place of origin, are generally past 30 years of age. The men are usually 35+. Both sides may have had a broken affair or two. The Bengali women is more likely to have had an affair with a non-Bengali man.\\n\\nBengali girls marrying non-Bengalis, irrespective of place of origin, are in the age group of 21–27, i.e. their prime age. In almost all cases in this category the Bengali lady has a baby within 1 to 1 and a half year of marriage.\\nBengali ladies adjust or rather compromise far more in marriages with non-Bengalis than they do in marriages with Bengali males, to the point of submission. Often times this results in substantial loss of independence, especially with respect to food habits and finance. This no wonder is a cause of delight to her non-Bengali in-laws who extol her virtues as the ideal daughter-in-law. One doesn’t know the reason for this behaviour. Perhaps there’s a guilty complex that since they took the decision on their own they must bear the cross of their decision owing to their high levels of conscientiousness.\\n\\nBengali girls, ostensibly feminist, take their freedom and liberalism to be license to choose a non Bengali husband where they have LESS freedom post marriage. It is often seen that the marriage turns abusive and the Bengali girl and her parents are left holding the bab(ies) quite liberally.\\n\\nIt is also seen that often when Bengalis marry their daughters to non-Bengalis they forget all principles and gift expensive items such as cars to the non-Bengali son-in-law, something that no Bengali son-in-law or Bengali family would even have demanded.\\n\\n\\nSome people wrote in to say that. but Ma’am, my non-Bengali guy is awesome and has all the qualities that I’m looking for. He’s rich, well educated, handsome, funny, caring and has great earning potential. So what if he’s non-Bengali? Also all of what you describe is in general and my guy doesn’t quite seem to fit your description. To those here’s my counter argument. Consider that you’re buying a flat or a house. You find this fabulous property, at the right price, at the right location. The construction also seems OK to you and the builder is promising to deliver your project on time. So you go on the internet and find that lo and behold this builder’s earlier projects are all mired in controversy. In one place he’s delivered behind schedule and in another his walls have seepage. So promptly you drop your plans of buying the flat at the builder’s current project, even though in the present case the builder has every intention of performing good construction and delivering the project on time. So you can draw parallels to your marriage from this example.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nPeople often ask as to why Bengali girls want to marry non-Bengalis. If I were to hazard a guess it would be one, low self-esteem and two, they don’t like their fathers’ personalities. The Bengali gentleman is too mild-mannered for his own good and women and daughters need a good father figure. If the father were stricter then they would have had more caste pride. In addition Bengali fathers don’t stand up to their wives and are not assertive with them which is why daughters don’t consider them to be “strong”.\\n\\nNevertheless, gentle Bengali lass, if even after reading this you insist on marrying a non-Bengali man insist on two things.\\n\\nThe marriage ceremony will be entirely by the Bengali method. i.e you will marry in a saree and not a lehenga or something and groom will wear a dhuti and topor provided as per custom by your family.\\nYou will never, repeat never, keep fasts for misogynistic and patriarchal festivals like “Karwa Chauth”. Say that your best wishes are always with your husband and even if you didn’t keep a fast he would do well and have a long life.\\nDon’t have a baby before 3 years of marriage. If the yellow matter hits the roof then you can make a less painful exit.\\n\\nInsist on cooking and eating non-vegetarian food at home, even if your non-Bengali husband doesn’t eat it. This is good for your health and if your husband and his family care for your health they will not oppose it.\\nBefore you get married to non-Bengali family think whether your daughter will be given the same opportunities, education, environment and freedom to choose, especially her life partner, as you have been given in your Bengali household.\\n\\nEnsure that you get married in the place where your parents live or in your home town in West Bengal. This is particularly important if god forbidding you are tomorrow forced to litigate with your husband’s family to enforce your rights. It is often seen that non-Bengali families getting married to Bengalis arrange for marriages at their hometowns in remote parts of North India. Think of this. If you ever need to litigate then it will be very difficult to enforce your rights from that remote town. Heck, you may not be able to even engage a local advocate. In addition the husband’s family may frustrate your attempts at justice by filing transfer petitions to delay and force you to surrender.\\n\\nDon’t engage in any side income business, such as Amway etc after marriage, just because your non-Bengali husband etc is doing it. Bengalis got better education to get better paying jobs so that they don’t have to do this. Bengalis earn money to save, spend on their children’s education and for travel. If your non-Bengali partner is not appreciative of this then perhaps you need to choose a different person. That said if you have a genuine business idea then by all means jump full fledged into it.\\n\\nSource: Quora\\n\\nTL;DR : Bengali women shouldn't trade their freedoms and kulcha.\", \"Well,We know Black money is being spent like rivers for Modi's very very special visit in the UK/US,places where he was banned for a decade.I want to know which criminals and anti-Indians are behind these sponsoring the stage shows.Are Hindu extremists sponsorng these make believe shows in his honour like some kind of tyrannical King of the 17th century.His own country is fucked up with so many issues, can you show this particular telecast to the farmers who are commiting suicides everyday.Can you show these to people who couldn't celebrate Diwali due to prize rise.What kind of image is he trying to portray by getting false appreciation by these NRI's whom I do not consider citizens of India paying taxes and working for Indian development.\\n\\nWhat does this Rioter of Godhra wants to prove by smugging the 85% of poor Indians who are crying each day cuz they cannot afford proper food to eat and fresh air to breathe.\\n\\nWhat kind of a Saddam Hussain like motherfucker Modi is doing there gaining praises from NRI's who stay there and develop British economy.\\n\\nPeople will downvote me for being a party pooper of Modi.But this is the reason I hate him for the most.He promised he will look after the poor and have will change India for good.His Acche Din joomla is after all a fake propaganda and he got what he wanted.A ticket to roam free in foreign countries and enjoying good times and slaves who chant Modi Modi while paying taxes for British and performing in his honour.\\n\\nMadarchod Modi,I wish you early natural death.\", 'See the text of the bill introduced in Lok Sabha here:\\n\\nhttp://164.100.24.219/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/asintroduced/63_2013_eng_ls.pdf\\n\\nSee Section 354A-1(iv):\\n\\n(iv) making sexually coloured remarks,\\n\\n\"(3) Any man who commits the offence specified in clause (iv) of sub-section (1) shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.\"\\n\\n--\\n354D.

(C) Modi has successfully cultivated the image of a \\nno-nonsense, law-and order politician among Gujarat voters. \\nThis image of Modi as a strong, decisive leader is what his BJP \\nsupporters hope will help him establish a foothold at the \\nnational level. \\n \\n11. (C) Modi\\'s role in the 2002 bloodshed continues to divide \\nGujaratis and Indians in general.  While he remains repugnant to \\nlarge numbers of people, particularly Muslims, human rights \\nactivists and educated urbanites with liberal or leftist \\nleanings, many in the Hindu majority view his actions in 2002 \\nfavorably.  Negative attitudes towards Muslims remain firmly \\nanchored among Gujarati Hindus.  Many feel that they, and not \\nthe Muslim minority, are the true second class citizens of \\nIndia.  Muslims often \"stepped out of line,\" prior to 2002, we \\noften hear, demanding and receiving exceptional treatment by \\npoliticians who felt the need to placate them on the basis of \\nperceived injustices carried out by the Hindu majority.  That \\nchanged when Modi came into power in 2002, they say.  While no \\none will openly condone the bloodshed of 2002, many Gujarati \\nHindus feel that Modi \"put Muslims into their place.\"  The BJP \\ncontinues to echo these themes in its national political stance, \\nespecially over issues such as Hajj subsidies, the Muslim civil \\ncode, the singing of Vande Mataram, or other such religiously \\nsensitive concerns. \\n \\n12. (C) Modi continues to support a Hindutva agenda in the \\nstate, with the recent passage of amendments to the state\\'s \\nanti-conversion law (ref A) being seen as a concession to his \\nsupporters on the Hindu right.  Both supporters and critics of \\nModi confirm that the state government continues to use \\nadministrative tools to marginalize and ghettoize the Muslim \\nminority. \\n \\n13. (C) At the same time, most interlocutors tell us that Modi \\ncannot gain anything more by openly pursuing an aggressive \\nHindutva agenda.  He already has the backing of those who \\napplaud his firm stand against Muslims, and he risks alienating \\nswing voters in Gujarat by being too openly communal.  Modi \\nunderstands that, outside of Gujarat, his role in the 2002 riots \\nhas damaged both his reputation and that of the state.  He also \\nrealizes that outbreaks of communal violence in Gujarat will \\nharm both his chances in the state and nationally, and hence he \\nhas given law enforcement agencies clear instructions to act \\nswiftly if violence breaks out, we have been told.  Several \\ninterlocutors cited Modi\\'s rapid reaction to the communal \\nrioting in Vadodara in May (ref B) as proof of his new strategy. \\n Modi allowed federal army troops to establish order, and he \\neven visited hospitalized Muslim victims of the riots in an \\nattempt to portray himself as a leader of all Gujaratis.\\n', '', '', \"Let me start by saying - Markaz should've wrapped this up way sooner.

The one that was probably reported the most was the protest by Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. News channels like NDTV and India Today repeatedly reported how the police used excessive force against “peaceful” protesters. We were told that the students were opposed to the omission of Muslims from the CAA and sought to fight against it to “save” Indian democracy and “secularism”.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhile going through posts on social media, I came across an interesting piece of information - that JMI reserved 50% of its seats for Muslims. Not having too much faith in the accuracy of social media posts, I wanted to verify if this was really the case. Because if it were, it would clearly show that JMI was anything but secular. And so I started to go through their official websites: www.jmi.ac.in and www.jmicoe.in. What I learnt during my research astounded me. I knew that Muslim institutions gave preferential treatment to Muslims over non-Muslims but I never expected it to be this bad. My article relies solely on the documents and information available on these two official websites. No third parties, no hearsay. All the sources and links are listed at the end of this article.\\n\\n  \\nTo begin with, the claim that 50% seats in JMI are reserved for Muslims is absolutely true. The following text has been taken from Page 30 of the 2018-19 prospectus of JMI. (as can be seen in the attached image)\\n\\n  \\n5.1  \\n(i) 30% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Muslim applicants.  \\n(ii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Women applicants who are Muslims.  \\n(iii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for “Other Backward Classes” (OBCs) and Scheduled Tribes who are Muslims.  \\nNote: If seats remain vacant in any program from amongst the 10% of the total number of seats earmarked as per 5.1 (ii) and (iii) above, such vacant seats shall stand transferred to the category 5.1(i),i.e., Muslim applicants.\\n\\n  \\nIn other words, 30% seats for Muslim applicants + 10% for Muslim women + 10% for Muslim OBC. If there are any vacant seats from the Muslim women or Muslim OBC category, then those seats would be transferred to other Muslim applicants. So there would AT LEAST 50% seats for Muslims in JMI. Why do I say at least 50%? Well, apart from the 50% reservation for Muslims, there’s 5% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (or PwD). This reservation for PwDs is not limited Muslims only but since the selection of students would be done by the JMI staff, they could opt for Muslims over PwDs from other religions. And on top of that, there’s 5% reservation for “Internal (Jamia) students” i.e. students of Jamia who have passed their qualifying examination (X or XII) from Jamia Schools. And given that the same 50% reservation policy for Muslims exists in Jamia schools, the students from this category could all be Muslims. So on the whole, there could be up to a maximum of 60% Muslims from the reserved categories.\\n\\n  \\nBut wait, it gets a lot worse!! There could be far more than 60% Muslims in a program / course. How? Because Muslims can also get admissions in the General category !!! In other words, 50% seats are reserved for Muslims only i.e. only Muslims can opt for these seats. Of the 5% reserved seats for PwDs, Muslims can be given preference. And 5% reservation for internal jamia students would almost certainly be all Muslims. On top of that, there would be Muslim applicants in the General category i.e. Muslims students who opt for admissions not via reservation but in the general category. So in the end, the percentage of Muslim students could be way more than 60%.\\n\\n  \\nTo find out the exact proportion of Muslim students, one would require the list of all admissions in a particular program / course. I did find the list of all admissions for the year 2019-20 but since those lists display only the registration number of the students and not their name and religion, it cannot be used to determine the exact number of Muslim students. However I did find the list of graduated students for the year 2018. This list mentions the name of the candidates in addition to the registration number. Here’s what I found:\\n\\n  \\na. In B.Tech Computer Engineering, 37 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 59%.  \\nb. In B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering, 40 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 64%.  \\nc. In B.Tech Mechanical Engineering, 43 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 66%.  \\nd. In B.Tech Civil Engineering, 51 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 78%.\\n\\n  \\nAssuming that the proportion of students in admission and graduation would be more-or-less the same, this data not only confirmed my suspicions that the percentage of Muslim students in various courses would be least 60% but went on to show that it may be as high as 80%. I analysed the data for these four streams of engineering. There are several other courses but I did not spend my time analysing each and every single one. For those who are interested to dig deeper, relevant links can be found at the end of this article. \\n\\n  \\nI then looked into scholarships i.e. what percentage of the total number of students who received scholarships were Muslims. Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia (AAJMI) is tasked with providing scholarships for JMI students. I found the list of the selected candidates for the current year.\\n\\n  \\nIn the first list, out of the 325 selected candidates, 303 are Muslims; which is 93% !!  And in the second list, 96 out of the 99 candidates are Muslims i.e. 97%. In other words, of all the students who received scholarship in 2019, approximately 95% were Muslims.\\n\\n  \\nThis data conclusively proves that an overwhelming majority of students at JMI are Muslims and that Muslims are given preferential treatment. I wondered if the same pattern holds true for the positions of deans and Heads of Department (HODs). And predictably enough, JMI does not disappoint !!\\n\\n  \\nOf the 37 heads of various departments, 32 are Muslim i.e. 86%. And when it comes to the Deans of faculties, 8 of the 9 are Muslim = 89% !! (Annual Report 2017-18)\\n\\n  \\nFinally, I went through the list of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors of JMI. By now, I’m sure you can guess what I would have found. Of the 11 Chancellors since 1920, not one is a non-Muslim. And the same holds true for VCs. Not one of the 15 Vice Chancellors since 1920 is a non-Muslim.\\n\\n  \\nSo in the end, *60-80% of the students, 95% of scholarship recipients, 86% of the HODs, approximately 90% of the Deans of faculties*, and all the past & present Chancellors & Vice Chancellors of JMI are Muslims !! And yet, they claim to fight for \"secularism\" !!!\\n\\n  \\nAsk yourself these simple questions:  \\n1. How serious can the students of such a university be about “secularism”?  \\n2. Should we as a nation pay any heed to their demands given their shameless hypocrisy?  \\n3. If they indeed were such strong believers in the idea of secularism then wouldn’t they start by secularising their own university first?  \\n4. Do the students and professors of this university have a moral right to oppose ANY act on the grounds of secularism?\\n\\n  \\nFor any unbiased reader, this article conclusively proves that the JMI is not interested in secularism in the least. Then why are they protesting CAA? In my opinion, the reasons are:  \\n1. Supreme Court’s decision in favour of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.  \\n2. Belief that Muslims must be loyal to fellow Muslims over the country i.e. Muslim Ummah (or Ummat).  \\n3. Rightly / wrongly concluding that NRC will be bad.\\n\\n  \\nIt is also very interesting how leftists / liberals and Muslims have learnt the subtle art of appropriating the Constitution to suit their own agenda. Everybody has heard the accusation that the CAA violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. One can find many Muslims, and non-Muslims, repeating the same crap. It is however very interesting that Muslims are demanding equality and cite Article 14 as the justification. Well, if they are so bent upon equality, then why don’t they accept the demand for Universal Civil Code (UCC)? NO!! You see, when the debate is about UCC, they quote Article 25 of the Constitution which gives the right to practice one’s own religion and claim various special privileges as a religious right; for eg. four wives, triple talaq, etc. And when the discussion pertains to giving citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Islamic countries, they jump to Article 14 !! In other words, they pick and choose that which suits them.\\n\\n  \\nSo the next time you meet a leftist/liberal or Muslim who says that they oppose CAA because it goes against Article 14 and the principle of equal treatment, ask him if he supports Universal Civil Code. If he denies or gives you a lengthy nonsensical answer as to why he opposes UCC, then he stands exposed ; proving that he / she is not really interested in secularism. \\n\\n  \\nIt is amazing that channels like NDTV who claim to present facts as they are have never seen fit to inform Indians about the vastly disproportionate number of Muslim students in JMI. Nor do they call out the hypocrisy of JMI “students”. If they would have, the whole country would have learnt that these protests have nothing to do with “secularism”.\\n\\n  \\nNow it is up to us to spread the word.

My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and families of the slain policemen, to the forces who were targeted, and the Indian nation at large. No person should have to receive the remains of their loved ones lost to terrorism.\\n\\nI am writing this as someone who has been trying to make sense of all of this for quite a few hours now. I am also making it a point to only post it on Reddit because it is easily the most sophisticated form of social media in our part of the world. I understand and completely empathize with the emotions right now, and I'll probably be downvoted, but I wanted to engage with you all in a dialogue in the wake of this crisis that has befallen our beloved subcontinent.\\n\\nAs a Pakistani who grew up in Lahore, I am no stranger to terrorism. I have not only faced it in my hometown, but my family has been a direct victim of it. The nation of Pakistan has paid a huge price to terrorism, home-grown or otherwise. And we continue to do so. Anyone who sympathizes with terrorists is a common enemy of the people of Pakistan and India, and there can never be two ways about it.\\n\\nHaving said that, I'm here to request you to take a deeper look into all of this before you come at our throats for this. I won't deny that Pakistan hasn't been involved in alternative warfare before (we're 1/10th the size of India, with a largely inferior defense machinery, our forces probably deemed it the only way of keeping the Indian advances in check - unfortunate), but this attack doesn't seem like the doing of Pakistan or its forces.\\n\\nLet's get some context. In recent times, the government has been trying its best to resume dialogue with India. There's the Kartarpur corridor that the government is really trying to push hard on. Also, in the upcoming days, Pakistan awaits MBS from KSA, and with him comes a lifeline for Pakistan. Kalboshan Yadav trial is set to start in a few days, and turning the world against us would do the country no good in the ICJ. And to dig even deeper, Pakistan would not want to give the Modi government a chance to run their anti-Pakistan narrative again and come back into power.\\n\\nUnsettling the status quo does not work in the favor of Pakistan, or our forces. Maybe, just maybe this is an all-Kashmiri attack this time around? Masood Azhar may have been in Pakistan at some point, but Jaish-e-Mohammad is banned here, and yes, these groups are capable of planning and carrying out activities on their own. Why do I know that? I grew up in Pakistan's decade of terror.\\n\\nI'm not a military shill. My history on my home sub will portray the opposite actually.I'm just here to request you to take a deeper look into everything before jumping to any conclusions. The media and the politicians will try to sell you a narrative because it works for them. We have all always maintained that Pakistanis and Indians have been kept at each others' throats for years because of our politicians, and not us. Maybe its stuff like this that allows them to do this and keep us this divided?\\n\\ntl;dr. Don't take the bait, India. Let us mourn this loss with you, and you'll find the people of Pakistan standing by your side in this hour of tragedy. Furthering the war, propaganda and hostilities will achieve neither of our countries anything.  \\n\\n\\nEdit: To those I may have triggered here, please don't mistake this as a plea for mercy. This is a request to bring logic and reason into the argument. It's time we did that for a change on both sides of the border. Pakistan has more to lose from this attack than you'd realize. I completely understand the emotion, and I do feel your pain, but the threats and words you retorted to is exactly what I'm requesting you to give a second thought to.\", \"I have met very few who wants South Indians to speak Hindi. We got your point, if you don't want, you don't speak.

I am a south Indian so I have a unique experience with the issue. I was born and raised in Hyderabad and am elsewhere now. So right from the beginning I have learned Telugu (Mother tongue), English and Hindi. I think I can maintain a conversation in Hindi but my accent is bad. I can read and write Hindi quite well.\\n\\nEveryone should learn their mother tongue first and foremost. So a telugu guy should learn telugu. A marathi guy should learn marathi. That is the first priority.\\n\\nNow the question is: Should you also learn Hindi? I think every Indian should learn Hindi.\\n\\nThe reasons IMO are as follows :-\\n\\n1. You can connect with 40% of Indian people. \\n2. Only 9% of Indians can speak English. This means you literally cannot talk to you many of your compatriots in the state we are in.\\n3. If everyone learns Hindi then every Indian can talk to each other. This improves the national fabric and brings us closer to each other.\\n4. English is and always will be a foreign language. Indians will never be able to truly own and embody a foreign language.\\n\\nFor too long the upper echelons of power in our country were run in English which only 9% people understand. Everyone else has been left out and they feel wronged and rightly so.\\n\\nOf course, the devil lies in the details. What should be the priority? Even i don't know the answer to that.\\n\\nIdeally every Indian should speak their mother tongue, Hindi and English and use which ever is convenient. If you are making a political speech in Hindi states use Hindi because you will connect with more people.

I am too small to rally against a government that has power over the public discourse, the tools and purveyors of justice and the very people itself. The government has taken over what I eat, what I see and what I read. It has also slowly taken away what I believe or at least what I used to believe in. The pride with which the mass thumps its chest as majoritarian while also contributing to a dictatorial view of the government that was elected is bothersome. It shows me that what is on paper is not in the minds of people, the rot has now reached a far deeper. There is no more intelligentsia that looks at problems objectively, the best minds converted to conformity or chased away.\\n\\nWhat is the pride in defending a country whose economy is about to falter? What is the pride in identifying with a mass? Why is there celebration over a perceived national and religious unity whereas basic necessities are not available to large swathes of the population and the country is built on a tattering education system that only reproduces but does not think? The colour of faith and national pride stops us from seeing the problems that plague us elsewhere, trying to pretend that our problems do not exist or trying to save face before the rest of the world is not a magic pill. The country was built on shaky foundations of poverty and misinformation, the political forces that followed have reaped merry on these resources. This could also be termed as a post-colonial hunt for identity and there is enough theory written, the practice is based on emotion and fear. No amount of sense can be breathed upon a person subsumed by thought control.\\n\\nSeeing the temple being built reaffirms that there is no longer a future in this country. All for what? A mythical character in a story who would not have cared if one worshipped him or not. Where the biggest issues is of an outside enemy the bigger problems that plague the country go unanswered. Since most of the population does not have a conception of what the Western idea of development is (thanks to shoddy education amongst other things) they are happy to accept what they get at face value. Today it is a mandir, tomorrow it is a pogrom. Who is to care? After all they are the majority and they feel powerful. This will not end here. Kashmir was the soup and this is the starter. It will not end before the Hindutva agenda is firmly pressed down our throats. The new generation will be an anal, flag flying and name chanting drones like the Turkish or Chinese goons that are also baying for blood. The ideals that shaped this country have been distorted and I have no longer have any hope for democracy or inclusion.\\n\\nI am not siding with this anymore. When the day comes when we hang our heads in shame I will not shrug and repent. Because I am not a part of this madness. The best I can do it to renounce all my affiliation with this ideology from now on. Mark my words for it will Kashi and Mathura next.

So, the administration\\'s resources would have to be wasted on \"security theater\" rather than actual security, which again slows growth. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how much of a probability I myself will attach to this theory, but I hope this at least gets some of you thinking about such possibilities.

These allegations are false cries and are disgusting. These allegations made by the opposition have been completely punctured after a point by point here.\\n\\n1. Allegation : The different purchases worth Rs. 206 Cr. For Anganwadis was carried out without eTendering process\\n\\nReality : This is a false allegation. The purchases made by Women and Child Development Department have been done based on Govt. Approved Rate Contracts. eTendering is not needed when the Rate Contracts are available.\\n\\n2. Allegation : The Government Resolutions related to the purchase have not been uploaded on the Govt. Website\\n\\nReality : As these are purchase related work orders, they were not put on the govt. website. In the tenure of the previous governments also, Govt. Resolutions related to any of the purchases were not put on the website\\n\\n3. Allegation : The purchase was approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha\\n\\nReality : The rate contract was approved on verification of all the points associated with the manufacturing units of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha by the Technical Team of the CSPO. The Women and Child Development Department has also verified the unit. Therefore the allegation that the purchases were approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity is wrong.\\n\\n4. Allegation : The purchase from M/s Bhavani Enterprises was approved in only one day\\n\\nReality : Rate Contract is available for M/s Bhavani Enterprises and therefore the purchase was approved. However, the propaganda being made in this regard is completely false. The purchase from M/s Bhavani Enterprises was approved on the basis of Govt. Rules and Laid Down process.\\n\\n5. Allegation : The contracts were allotted to unauthorized Firms\\n\\nReality : This allegation is also an utter falsehood. The purchase orders were allotted to the firms authorized in Rate Contracts provided by the approved agencies. Contracts are not allotted to any unauthorized firm.\\n\\n6. Allegation : M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. does not have copyright registration\\n\\nReality : Shree Tekawade has done the copyright consent agreement with M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. In this, as per the Terms and Conditions of the contract, the rights for printing, selling, and publication of the associated books are available with M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd and therefore purchase order was given to M/s Jagadguru Printing Press.\\n\\n7. Allegation : Cheque of value of Rs. 5.6 crores was credited into the account of the contractor\\n\\nReality : This allegation is also a complete falsehood. The Commissioner of Women and Child Development has issued the cheque in the same of the associated firm i.e. M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. The cheque was not issued in the same of any individual.\\n\\n8. Allegation : The Water Filter of value Rs. 4500 was purchased at Rs. 5200.\\n\\nReality : The Govt. Rate contract mentions the cost of Water Filter at Rs. 4500/- and Water Filter with Storage Capacity at Rs. 5200/-. The water filter with storage capacity has been purchased and therefore the allegations made in this regard are baseless and misleading for the people. The water filter with storage capacity has been done based only on the costs mentioned in the Rate Contract.\\n\\n9. Allegation : M/s Suryakanta does not have its plant to manufacture Chikki\\n\\nReality : M/s Suryakanta has its own plant. This plant is at Vengurla and it has been verified.\\n\\n10. Allegation : The provision for Medical Kits was for Rs. 500 and yet, Rs. 720 were charged.\\n\\nClarification: This allegation is also completely false and misleading. Medical Kits have been purchased based on the provisions of the Central Govt. at Rs. 599/-. As per the Terms and Conditions mentioned in the Tender, The Commissioner (Integrated Child Development Scheme) has the rights to change the quantity of the Medicines and the cost of Medical Kit was reduced to Rs.599/- from Rs. 720/- to fit into the limit of Central Govt. of Rs. 600/-.\\n\\nMisinformation in regards to eTendering\\n\\nThe state govt. has issued a GR through General Administration Department on 18. December 2014, making it mandatory for carrying out purchases above Rs. 3 Lakhs. However, this tender is for carrying out e Tendering instead of paper based Tendering for all purchases above Rs. 3 Lakhs and therefore for any of the purchases, if the Rate Contracts are already available, e Tendering is not required. The purchases done by the Women and Child Development Department are as per the Rules and Regulations as mentioned above. These purchases are done on the basis of the Rate Contracts finalized by the Director General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS & D) of the Industries Department and Central Government. Also, all the purchases were made in FY 2014-15 i.e. before March 2015.\\nHowever, the Government Orders, making e Tendering mandatory for any purchases above Rs. 1 Crore even if the Rate Contract are available, were issued after this period, i.e. on 17. April 2015. However, it may be noted that the above purchases were done before March 2015. Therefore the question of carrying out eTendering for purchases above Rs. 1 Crores did not arise.\\nIf the decision of the aforementioned purchases was not taken, it would not have been possible to utilize the funds in the then current Financial Year i.e. before 31. March 2015. These funds would have been lapsed and the funds would not be available for the anganwadi children and the funds would have been available only in the new financial year with a delay. The Central Govt. share in this funds would have been lapsed and would not have be available again. In the mean time, the beneficiaries of this schemes would be completely neglected and the supplies would have been shut for them.\\n\\nThe purchases of the previous govt. on the basis of the same Rate Contract\\n\\nIt may be noted that the Rate Contract used for above mentioned purchases were finalized in the time of the previous Congress-NCP Govt. Also, the previous Congress-NCP Govt. did purchases on the basis of the same Rate Contracts. It needs to be understood that the purchases of Rs. 164 Crores in 2012-13, Rs. 127 Crores in 2013-14 ad Rs. 56 Crores in June-July 2014 have been made.\\n\\nTherefore the news is completely baseless and far from reality.', '', '', '', 'They seem fixated with AAP. \\n\\nThey do more to promote AAP then AAP supporters themselves.', 'A few days ago, a friend of mine asked me why young, intelligent Indians (I\\'ll get to that in a bit) professionals don\\'t try to stay and bring about change in their homeland.

The Albuquerques and their successors succeeded in supplying Europe with pepper and paintings only through carnage\\n\\n – Voltaire, Fragments historiques sur l\\'Inde, op.cit., p.383\\n\\n\\n* **He was very fond of Hindus and Hinduism**\\n\\n In contrast to his views on their invaders, he viewed Hindus as \"peaceful and innocent people, equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves\". \\n\\n He also said about Vedas that \"The Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East\".\\n\\n* **His views on Christianity and Islam**\\n\\n He wrote this about Christianity in a letter to King of Prussia -\\n\\n >**[Christianity] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world.** Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. … My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out..\\n\\n His opinion about Islam wasn\\'t much better.\\n\\n He described Mohammed as a \"deceitful character.\" He wrote that **Mohammed was \"whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command.\"**\\n\\n He considered Quran to be ignoring the laws of physics. Thus, there are a number of representations of Mohammed by Voltaire, a religious one, according to which Mohammed is a prophet like the others, who exploits people\\'s naivety and spreads superstition and fanaticism, and the other a political one, according to which Mohammed was a legislator who brought his contemporaries out of idolatry. According to Diego Venturino, Voltaire applauds the legislator but hates the conqueror and the pontiff, who established his religion through violence.\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: In the above, all sentences that appear unsourced are taken/paraphrased from the wikipedia article on voltaire.', '', '', '', \"Yesterday, we were having a debate about national politics in our society and suddenly the topic of emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in 75-77 came up.

The boat burnt and sank in the same position, in the early hours of 1 January.\\n\\n- While there has been speculation that this could have been a aborted fidayeen attack, DNA also quoted a senior intelligence official as saying, \"If it really was a boat carrying terrorists for a 26/11 kind of an attack, its crew would have attacked the Coast Guard ship first and blown up the boat only after harming the Coast Guard.\"\\n\\n- Meanwhile, an Indian Express report said, \"new evidence has begun to emerge that those on board might have been small-time liquor and diesel smugglers, ferrying bootleg cargo from the port of Gwadar to other fishing boats which were to have carried it into Karachi\\'s Keti Bandar harbour.\"\\n\\n- Even as the incident saw much shock and speculation in India, Pakistan vehemently denied that the boat was carrying terrorists. Pakistani Foreign Office Spokesman Tasnim Aslam categorically denied the reports and told the media that no boat from Karachi had gone to the open seas. Pakistan\\'s Defence Ministry officials also rejected the reports and said the Indians were \"trying to divert attention\" from the killing of two Pakistan Rangers on 31 December. \"It is part of Indian propaganda to tarnish the image of Pakistan,\" a Defence Ministry official told PTI.\\n\\n- On Friday, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said, \"I congratulate the Coast Guard for the timely action of intercepting a boat carrying suspected terror groups with surgical precision, thereby eliminating danger.\"\\n\\n- However, according to DNA, intelligence officers are still wondering why the boat was chased. It reports that, \"According to UN convention, a nation can chase or intercept suspicious vessels if they prohibit the passage of the host nation\\'s passage or if they (suspicious vessels) loiter above or under the surface of the sea. That was not the case here, officials say.\"\\n\\n- While neither Gujarat or Maharashtra police were informed about any intelligence report about any boat along the coast being watched, a senior Gujarat police official told Indian Express, \"You don\\'t need to be a genius to figure out we should have been told, because, if the fishing boat was actually carrying explosives and managed to evade patrols on the seas, we should have been in position waiting for it.\"\\n\\n- As speculation mounts on whether this was actually a terror attack or not, Indian Express said three naval officers had told the newspaper, \"it was inconceivable that Pakistani fishing boats -typically four-crew vessels, with an average length of less than 25 metres and equipped with 80-220 horsepower diesel engines, or smaller mechanised sailboats with 30 horsepower engines - could outrun the Coast Guard\\'s state-of-the-art ships.\"', 'Yesterday, I saw the cricket match and I was very happy about the results.

Of course, you can\\'t put anything past anyone these days, but I highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives, away from civilization, locked in mosques around the world, praying, and talking about praying when they\\'re not actually praying, would do anything like that.

They\\'re literally oblivious, which exactly why they didn\\'t pay heed to the coronavirus situation. Granted, that was extremely dangerous and wrong, but I still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs, much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses. \\n\\nObviously, there is zero proof of any such occurrence. Aaj Tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds, which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour, while yelling about \"jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot\".

Virtual hugs to all fellow nationalists!', '', 'Ok, I had enough of this intolerance debate, like most of you, but not in the way you think. Let me define the two sides in this debate first. I am on the side of the so called ‘intellectuals’, ‘liberals’, or ‘pseudo secularists’, and the ‘other side’ that I’ll refer to below is the people who are of the opinion that this intolerance talk is a bunch of politically motivated crap and everyone doing it has a political agenda, OR…(drumbeat).. is an ‘anti national’! One thing we’ll all agree on, I believe is there is a lot of intolerance on the conversation about intolerance\\n\\nFor the intolerance deniers, if you really don’t think sentiments have been changing in the past few years, then you definitely are not reading anything online. Just take a look at the comments section (below) of any article that has any reference to Muslims, intolerance, or could be on any other topic but is just authored by a Muslim. The comments are so ‘colorful’ and ‘abusive’ against a certain community that there are more ‘special character’ letters being used than regular characters, and almost universally all the dirty expletives are being uttered by Hindus (or Whites/Christian Majority nations) against Muslims. \\n\\nThe level that our dear Indians have stooped to, in online conversation, is beyond what the rest of the world has done and the conversations start and end with disgusting ‘maa behen’ language against a certain community. Just based on religion, without knowing who the person is, or what their views are. The anonymity that the online world provides is exposing the true mindset of the majority community in India, and in many other nations as well. Let’s focus on India though, as the reasons for Muslim hatred vary a bit based on the country. The majority will say that the Muslim hatred in rooted in them being the source/cause of terrorism, support our neighbouring country, give importance only to their religion, or they are against our country. Seriously? That is very similar to saying that all blacks (say in USA) are criminals and drug dealers, or all Tamils are terrorists (as they sympathized with LTTE), or all Biharis in Mumbai are paanwallas. Judging a whole community because of a few bad elements in it is as horrible a crime as can be. After 9/11, many Americans thought anyone with a brown skin is an Arab and a terrorist. Do we really want to stoop so low in our thinking? Can’t we differentiate between innocent women and children being killed in Gujarat (even if they are Muslims) vs. the real extremists (such as ISIS) being killed? Aren’t Hindus known to be the inheritors of the Ram Rajya of ‘dharma’ and justice, who will never punish an innocent person? A true believer of Dharma will never allow the killing of an innocent person to go unpunished, no matter what religion the person belongs to. \\n\\nThis is a good Segway to the first talking point of the so-called hypocrisy that the other side accuses the ‘intellectuals’ of. We only raise a hue and cry when Muslims are affected, but not when Hindus are affected. For example, did the media make a big issue of the Kashmiri Pundits being kicked out of Kashmir? (You can almost see their heads nodding arrogantly on reading this). That is the typical hogwash that they emit to try to convince themselves about how wrong the other side is. The thinking and principles of the ‘intellectuals’ is crystal clear..we will oppose anybody who harms an innocent person. This means we will strongly oppose animals like ISIS members, the killers of the Bangladeshi Bloggers, 26/11 Terrorists, Godhra train killers, AND the killers of innocent people in the Godhra riots, killers of Sikhs in 1984, killers of an innocent person in Dadri, and killers of an innocent write in Karnataka who spoke about intolerance. \\n\\nAll these are grave crimes that cannot go unpunished. Justice should see no distinction and take no sides.  We are the ones opposing ALL forms of injustice, whereas the only response you guys have when asked about an innocent minority person being killed is ‘Why are not talking about Kashmiri Pundits’?,  or something of that sort. We are NOT the hypocrites, YOU are! Case CLOSED, and hypocrisy EXPOSED! There is no explanation that you can give to justify that reaction. An innocent person being killed should be condemned. Period. The fact the you guys are trying to avoid or cover up or distract from the topic of innocent killings shows that you actually condone it, and that is a result of the hatred in your mind. There is no other explanation, so stick your response you’re forming in your mind, in your ‘ear’!\\n\\nWhen Aamir Khan highlighted atrocities against Dalits and women in Satyamev Jayate, he was given an award by the NCSC in 2012! The same person when he highlights atrocities against Muslims, is suddenly ‘anti-national’? People talking about the nation’s capital being the ‘rape capital’ of the country are not damaging the reputation of the country, but when Aamir mentions he’s alarmed about some recent kilings the country he is ‘destroying’ the reputation of the country? Amartya Sen, Raghuram Rajan, Vishal Dadlani and numerous other hindus have also spoken out about intolerance, but there are no protests against them and no stones being thrown at their houses and cars! Moreover, it was Kiran Rao who (allegedly) made the comments, but the protests are only against Aamir Khan? That is unquestionable evidence of the hypocrisy of the ‘other side’ (many of them BJP supporters), and there is nothing you can say which can explain it away. \\n\\nHinduism used to be associated with the best qualities – tolerance, peace, kindness, non-violence, intellectual pursuits, karma, dharma etc. etc. – and it used to have ideals that many people looked up to and aspired to emulate. I am infuriated that all these qualities are slowly being extinguished by the current mindset in India, and all these so called ‘Indians’ are destroying the image of Hinduism due to the depraved, communal, and inhuman mindset they are displaying in this whole debate.  Now, these swarms of ‘educated’ Indians who only spew anger and venom, and label anyone highlighting abhorrent incidents or differing views an ‘anti national’ and  ‘enemy of the state’. \\n\\nThese ‘differences’ existed for many years, but what has changed now? I remember ShahRukh Khan made a statement in 2010 about allowing Pakistani cricketers into India and Shivsena created a ruckus and blocked MNIK screenings. But that reaction was the only limited reaction in Mumbai, and most people opposed that action from Shiv Sena. Fast forward to 2015, and a brief mention about intolerance from SRK is enough to throw vile insults, ‘anti national’ barbs, stones at his home and car, and ban his movies! The difference is that people are now emboldened to openly vent and proudly display their hatred and communal feelings in the garb of ‘patriotism’, because the ruling government has made it acceptable and ‘patriotic’ to do so. It is the same as Muslim extremists crawling out from the ground in the middle east, after ISIS came up and put forth an ideology that extremists could justify as ‘pure ISLAM’ (yes, women salves can be justified by ISIS!)\\n\\nYes, I am intolerant too, and I don’t have any qualms to admitting it! I am intolerant to people who when asked about a murder of an innocent person respond with ‘well, why are you not asking about the innocent people who got killed xx years ago?’ I am intolerant about the person who when asked about 1000s of innocent Muslim deaths in 2002, gave the answer ‘Well, why are you not asking me about the 56 deaths in the train?’ Well, Mr. PM and supporters, who the eff says the 56 deaths is not a heinous crime in itself? We do see the culprits of that crime being prosecuted though, whereas the response for the 1000s of other innocent deaths is either ‘well, if certain people cross their limits then they have to be taught a lesson’ at worst or  ‘well, it is tough to control angry mobs, and the other side is to blame for inflaming them in the first place’ at best!\\n\\nI am sure that the people on the other side of this debate are grinding their teeth in anger and foaming at the mouth right now, for if there is one thing they cannot ‘tolerate’ it is somebody telling them they are wrong! I also know that this will not even change one person’s mind on the other side, for the opinions and hatred are so strongly formed in their thick skulls that you cannot penetrate it with a nuke. The only reason why I’m sending this is to rally the few individuals who are on my side and who are the saving grace of the country. We need to come together and mount a massive david vs goliath campaign against these destroyers of Indian democracy and Hinduism, because we are not going to back down on this war. This is bigger than the battle for independence of the country, and like we shuttled the brits out at that time we’ll make sure we’ll rid the nation of this poisonous mindset.

It wouldn't have been difficult for him to immediately arrest people involved in train burning incident and prosecute them.

In one year from GODHRA incident and riots, only DEVELOPMENT he probably brought to people of Gujarat was a burnt train, parked in a yard, and an empty, burnt, and broken Gulbarg Society.

Evil triumphed over truth. \\n\\nModi came to power and surprisingly BJP lost at the center because what BJP was trying to master, congress had already mastered.

This is a purely hypothetical situation and you can argue that this would never happen. But if it did, would you eat human meat that was advertised in such a way that it made you think more about how delicious it would be as opposed to how it was raised or killed for that matter. \\n\\nPlease remember that I've nothing against people who oppose meat ban. It's just that I normally see argument against beef ban supporters like, if you want to ban eating beef, why not meat and chicken too ? And if you're banning meat, why not ban eating plants too, as they are living beings and they can feel to ? I've no argument against this statement. \\n\\nYou can say that even if the human I'm talking about is close to an animal, it would still feel the same feelings that we do, albeit crudely. Also, you can say that it would be difficult to watch something that looks so much like a human, to be killed right in front of your eyes in shops that sell fresh meat. \\n\\nYou might not agree with this, but I think cows and humans or other animals feel the same basic feelings. I personally think that although humans have a really advanced brain, they can do things that animals might never be able to. Also, we can ask questions about ourselves, our existence, we have free will. I'm sorry if I missed any other important things that we humans can do. But I think, at the end it all boils down to eating, sleeping, sex, excretion and other basic processes. Of course this is a really stupid generalization as I am basically summarising the entire heap of human achievements in a mere one line. \\n\\nI personally think that we should be free to eat whatever we like, because we basically rule the world. When I say we rule the world, I mean that we are the most dominant race out of all living beings. You can argue that, deadly virus or bacteria would be a good candidate too, so let's say that we are one of the most powerful races of living beings. Even if people argue that eating beef, or meat is morally wrong, what is right and what is wrong is subjective. So, eating beef or meat is a choice of the individual. \\n\\nSome world governments have declared some species as protected and you cannot kill them because they are on verge of extinction and they are important part of the food pyramid. Wiping them out of the face of Earth would been disruption in the food chain and other effects on the environment. So, basically you cannot kill some species even if they are pretty dangerous to deal with like, tigers, lions and other carnivore animals. Their numbers are pretty small in size, so they can't do much anyway, although there are exceptions like tigers attacking tribal people living in the area. \\n\\nThis further reaffirms the fact that we humans can do whatever we want. Since cows, pigs and other livestock are available in abundance, there won't be any environmental impact and we can kill as many as we want. But, what would we do if there was a hypothetical situation where humans that I described before were a part of livestock too ? Would we eat them too ? What would happen if someday the livestock we've been killing since thousands of years turn intelligent and do the same thing to us ? What would be our thoughts when another dominant race comes in and starts killing us for food and we can't do anything about it ? Would our feelings be the same as the thousands of cows, pigs and chickens we kill everyday for food ? Would we feel the same way on the verge of death as those animals do ? A lot of these situations are pretty hypothetical and stupid what-if situations which might never happen.

One of the main reasons is, we are in a position where we cannot use our vast superiority in conventional weapons/military. It is very dangerous and almost impossible to have a limited scope conventional battle between 2 nuclear powers.\\nIt is very easy for it to escalate into a nuclear war.\\n\\nFor people who want a lot more detailed version of this post, take a look at this MIT lecuture on India-Pakistan clusterfuck. Start at 35mins if you want to skip details about nuclear weapons in general\\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-8-004-reducing-the-danger-of-nuclear-weapons-and-proliferation-january-iap-2015/videos/lecture-1-south-asia-under-the-shadow-of-nuclear-weapons/\\n\\nThis is one of the most unbiased sources you will find. It is given by an Indian/ABCD prof Vipin and you will see that it is relatively unbiased. No professor, TV channel in India will have the balls to look at things this objectively.\\n\\n1971 war was pretty bad on Pakistan and they were not ready to lose a conventional battle to India again. Indira Gandhi tested a nuclear device, which is technically not a bomb, was dubbed as nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes. World bought it to a certain extent except Pakistan, \\nwhere the famous words \"we will eat grass, but we will get nuclear weapons too\". But ours was not a bomb. It was a bulky, almost 2x the size of a car, which could never be mounted on a plane/missile.\\n\\nThen Narasimha Rao\\'s government was very close to testing the weapon and declaring India as a nuclear state. Till then India was not a official nuclear state so the world was unsure. Thanks to pressure from US, they did not test it.\\n\\nEnter BJP, they even had it in their manifesto that they will test it. They made it an issue of national pride, almost saying the congress govt was afraid of the \\'west\\'. This issue became a big deal, got politicized and was made a matter of nationalism and the leaders did not really grasp the scale of what they were talking about.\\nBasically doing anything to win the election.\\n\\nThen comes the test in 1998 tests. India proudly announced to the world effectively that they were a nuclear state. Nationalism and chest thumping everywhere. 2 weeks later Pakistan did it too. This changed the equation between India and Pakistan forever.\\n\\nWhy?\\nIt is almost like Pakistan was baiting India. Both countries had been working on the weapons since the 1970s test and were waiting for each other to test it. Because the country that tests first will face the international ire, sanctions and second country gets to say \"they did it.we are doing it for self defense\"\\nI am sure Pakistan was hoping India would test it, because once India tests and makes it legitimate that they are a nuclear country, Pakistan can do it too and announce they are a nuclear country too. This erased India\\'s conventional military superiority advantage overnight.\\nAll because some retarded overly nationalistic leaders put it in their manifesto.\\n\\nWhat could India have done? It could have developed it, kept the world guessing if it had the weapons. Unofficially all countries knew India had the weapons and yes, China would not have messed with India because even though India say they dont have it, China knows India does. They would not have taken that chance.\\nHow does it help with Pakistan? Because both sides are publicly saying they dont have nuclear weapons, say India wanted to enter pakistan and destroy a few terror camps. India could have used its conventional army and done that. Its like 2 card players hiding their best cards and holding on to it, bluffing that they dont have it while both sides know they do.\\nIndia folded first and showed its cards. India could always use its conventional army for limited scale objective missions. Pakistan would be in a position where they cannot use their weapons unless India went all in, trying to invade all the way to Islamabad, then all bets were off.\\n\\nNow, Pakistan says \"any missile fired from Indian side, we automatically assume that it is a nuclear weapon and will respond with a nuclear weapon.\"\\n\\nBecause they are technically right. India is a self certified nuclear state and they cant risk a single missile landing there, wait for it to explode and see if that was \\na nuclear weapon and then respond. So now, even a single missile fired towards paksitan will get a nuclear response from them and so India\\'s hands are tied.\\n\\nPakistan knows this and started testing India\\'s patience. Kargil in 2001, Parliament attack in 2002 and several others all the way to Mumbai. It is no coincidence that attacks from Pakistan suddenly increased after 2000. Pakistan must have been laughing loudly when these happened because we could not do squat. Why? we both legitimized our nuclear weapons and our conventional army is tied up. \\nIf we had maintained we did not, but developed it secretly and kept it, it would have left them guessing. An attack happens on the parliament? retaliate with conventional army. Nuclear? what nuclear? we keep saying \"we dont have nuclear weapons\" and continue with conventional battle. Pakistan cant use their nuclear weapons too.\\nBut in our present case, one Indian army bomber crosses into Pakistan, all they need to do is \"their bomber is here to drop nuclear weapons, we cant wait and see what it is. we retaliate\"\\n\\nBJP\\'s over nationalism basically fucked up the situation.\\n\\nSame happening all over again with Balochistan. That was our trump card. Entire world knows we are involved there but we kept denying it as no official announced that we are. Pakistan just kept crying that we are and world did not know what to do. Who were we kidding when we built 6 \"embassies\" in afghnistan. Why do we need that many there?\\nWe are second biggest donors for Afghanistan after US. Whole world knows whats happening and they kept quiet and Pakistan was the only one complaining. Then comes Modi announcing it to the world, to make his supporters at home feel like we are actually doing something when the govt is getting humiliated in Kashmir.\\nWhat changed now? Not a damn thing in Balochistan, we were involved before, will be involved in the future. The only difference is, now Pakistan has an official statement from our PM to point to, when any terror attack happens related to Balochistan. Pakistan-China economic corridor passes right through, China knew India \\nwas involved in derailing attempts, now our great PM made it official. China now is openly saying \"India is derailing our economic projects there. Your PM just said it!\" We have effectively legitimized their support of terror in Kashmir because our PM openly said we are supporting inside their country!

Modi, like a lot of his ideas, has borrowed and reinvented it into - support for Modi, is support for India. \\n\\nThis is incredibly influential on you if you believe in it, and mindboggling if you don't - so, a classic cult. But politics in India has been like that for a long time, since Mahatma Gandhi, so let's not talk about that. But a few points on the appeal of the India-Purusha Narendra Modi - the man who is India, for his supporters. Why is his cult as it is?\\n\\nI have three reasons.\\n\\nOne, genuine anti-incumbency. This is still a thing - look at Punjab, Goa, Delhi, et al. There is still huge negativity regarding how government functions, regardless of party, and generally people still vote against parties to show their frustration. \\n\\nTwo, genuine solutions based politics. Now, India-Purusha's solutions are often seen as rudimentary and simplistic by those with higher proficiency in policy analysis. But that's not his target. Jaitley deals with that through his lawyerly dark arts. Modi offers simple, direct and immediate solutions to what we can call the 'nouveau literate' - segments of the citizenry which is newly literate, especially in IT, who can understand information from different sources, especially Social Media, but are still not proficient enough to dig deeper and do critical analysis. This allows India-Purusha to selectively feed information, and then provide simple solutions, emerging as the saviour/champion.\\n\\nThree, consolidation of Hindu vote bank. For a long time Hindu votes have been fragmented by caste, India-Purusha has the genuine ability to unite Hindus despite caste. Now, most times, this is unity against Muslims, building on point one, using point two, but he is a genuine mass leader, like Indira, like Nehru.\\n\\nThis is a new era of politics, our old formulas don't work. The question is, is this a permanent change or the consequences of a single man's rise to power. Only time will tell. It's too soon anyway to talk of a post-Modi era, because India-Purusha is, right now, only beginning.\\n\\nWe must all get used to hearing Har Har Modi and Namo, Namo for a long time yet.\\n\\nEdit: A clarification regarding the concept of 'nouveau literate' - I don't imply this to be a class specific category. It applies to two main sections of society - across caste, class, region etc. One, young voters, especially those who became politically active because of Modi from UPA's latter years. Two, older voters who're just beginning to use Facebook, WhatsApp etc. and who generally rely on this for information. Again, this is not a class specific thing.\", \"Let me start by saying that its my personal experience.

My hypothesis is that since it is usual for boys to approach girls, they have become used to getting approached and rejecting and its a second nature for them to move on instantly.

There was no hunger, nor there was poverty. All the farmers were billionaires so no one ever committed suicide. It was a wonderful country where people could eat as much beef they wanted, anywhere they wanted. There were no laws banning cow slaughter in any state. No one had heard of words like corruption, murders and rape. \\n\\nCommunal violence and riots were unheard of.

We should all know by now even if India accounted for the massive under reporting of rape we would still not even make the top 20 countries for rape per capita. Rape is an epidemic worldwide, it happens in all corners and all forms. \\n\\nAnd yet in western media narrative India is singled out as to make it seem we hold the exclusive rights to rape.\\n\\nThe problem with the Delhi rape was the manner in which it occurred and gruesomeness of it, which of course became free fodder for a western media already foaming at the mouth. But surely we don't believe that this was any worse the case of say Elizabeth Fritzl where the woman was held for over 20 years and raped while being held in a dungeon or  the case John Jamelske a serial rapist and murder . Yet we never saw a documentary or an outcry of rapes in America. Am I  excusing what happened certainly not. But surely it doesn't take a genius to recognise that the topic of rape and has somehow become the raison d'etre of the western media's narrative on India.\\n\\nA place where men apparently can't control themselves. \\n\\nOf course knowing the history of western mainstream media we would know why this happens . \\n\\nIt simply goes to a little book called Manufacturing consent by Noam Chomsky.\\n\\nDo we ever hear about epidemic of rape in Australia or Sweden where there is the highest rape per capita in the world? Or did anyone make a documentary about these countries no. We are constantly led to believe western countries especially US and England are somehow places of upotpia whose citizens and governments can do no wrong ; despite Americans being responsible for the biggest genocide in the 21st century we in no way conflate Americans with murder. And yet somehow we a narrative continues that India and Indian men are rapists. \\n\\nBut this is what they do they tell us Russia is bad and out to take over Ukraine despite the West being responsible for over throwing a sovereign Ukrainian government . They tell us the Chinese are aggressive and convince us we must join to stop this future world menace by surrounding them. Or the latest documentary which paints China as ignorant of the pleas of its people polluting them to their deaths despite every western nation having gone through the same process.\\n\\nWe saw a article in the economist which had no real substance but continously ranted about how India is somehow responsible for all the ills in cricket.\\n\\nAm I saying India doesn't have problems . No. But this is what they do .\\n\\nSurely at some point Indians will recognise that this is what the western media do . They manufacture consent. They continously drum through narrative . Narrative which is repeated enough times may actually cause their target audience to believe it to be true. In the 80's it was the USSR is bad and open up your economies and take IMF loans. \\n\\nToday its India is a land of rapists.\\n\\nAt some point we are going to have to stop taking the bait, or believe in the belittling that is constantly drummed out by a hemisphere which loses its influence everyday .

The inbred kid fuckers called me for the interview. There were 2 fuckfaces interviewing me: one a Bihari Math Professor who probably knows about 50 words in English, and a mallu man, whose wife probably fucks guys half her age in shitty blue films: hence, the reason why he had a perpetually frowning face.\\nI smiled and politely wished them, \"Good morning, sir\", twice, since there were two of them. But they didn\\'t even look up! They just said, \"take a seat quickly.\" I smiled and controlled my anger. They then asked me the usuals: where does your dad work, what does your mom do et cetera. They then looked at my 10th and 11th report card (i had scored 90 per cent in tenth ICSE, but my percentage dipped to 76 per cent,due to my bitch of a math teacher in my school, who couldn\\'t teach math AT ALL, while I had an average of around 84 per cent, amongst the other subjects. I\\'m in ISC, by the way) and asked me, \"bhy did urr perchentage diph?\", To which I gave a shitty reply: something something I didn\\'t put enough hard work, I have improved in twelfth grade something something (I really did improve in twelfth grade, I had an average of 83 per cent in my second preboards). There was an awkward silence for about 10 seconds. The mallu then asked me, \" white waere you at sent for yoour first semester exams?\". I was admitted to the hospital during this period for about 5 days, and was bedridden for nearly a month. I told them this. They thought I was lying. \\n\\nFuckers. \\n\\nAnyway, the mallu mone asked me what my favourite subject was in economics. I replied: Keynesian economics. I said that Keynesian economics is ideally what economics must choose to achieve: to maximise human welfare. The cunt must\\'ve felt overwhelmed by my response. He then begins asking me technical questions. The fucker thought that I didn\\'t know the answer to textbook questions and definitions. Boy was he wrong. \\nOnce the mallu ran out of questions, the Bihari Math cunt pounced in with the stupidest question: \"bhat is the dephinisun opf determinants?\" \\n\\nWhat. The. Fuck.\\n\\nWho the FUCK KNOWS. It\\'s a bunch of numbers with 2 lines on the sides. I said I didn\\'t know the definition. The Bihari fuck wasn\\'t that bad though, to be honest: his questions were all right.\\n\\nOne of my dad\\'s friends, whose daughter studies in Christ, told me that their strict dress code was understandable: it instils discipline, he said. REALLY? NOT BEING ALLOWED TO ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES? IS THAT REALLY DISCIPLINE?\\n\\nAfter ALL THIS, I found out later that night, that I did not get into that shit hole. I also found it that a guy who scored 53 per cent got in. I lost my shit after hearing that. \\n\\nTL:DR\\nFUCK CHRIST UNIVERSITY. FUCK THEIR SNOOTY ATTITUDE. FUCK THEIR SHITTY NOTHING-BUT- SHIRTS AND TROUSERS-DRESS CODE. \\n\\nCunts.\\n\\nEdit: I guess I let my anger combined with my disappointment\\u200b take the better of me. Now that I look back at the post, I guess I may have overreacted and was unwarranted.\\n\\nIt\\'s just that this really made me give up all hope of me getting in a college and rekindled my depression. I was always called a failure by my dad. This just proved to be a testament to that fact. I guess that\\'s why I was so carried away emotionally while writing this post.

Political groups used this legitimate issue and spun it into a guilt trip against their rivals. It may lead to a few electoral gains in the short run but over the long run, it leads to a massive under-current of resentment and a vicious backlash. Today, \"secularism\" is a joke in the Indian political discourse. \"True\" seculars are now begging people to forget all the propaganda in the name of secularism and revert back to its original nature.\\n\\nNow these same elements (who ruined secularism) are trying to spin another legitimate issue (women\\'s issues) into a guilt trip.\\n\\nJust take a look at this article: [Women in India Aren’t Safe on Twitter Either: The sexual humiliation of the streets has moved online](https://medium.com/matter/no-safe-places-d59af0c3ba58).\\n\\nThis article is a joke. \\n\\n> These days, though, nowhere is protected: some Indian men are determined to use the web to target women whose opinions they hate or fear. And, just like street hoodlums, they employ a mob mentality, work in packs, and deploy sexual language to terrorize and humiliate women.\\n\\n.\\n\\n> It’s clear from their online behavior that these men are largely privileged Hindus, many of whom live outside India and enjoy well-paying jobs. Prominent political journalist Sagarika Ghose, who has 361,000 followers on Twitter, calls them “communal techies.” She also coined the now-ubiquitous term “Internet Hindu” in a reference to their infatuation with the Hindu right wing nationalist ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won an overwhelming majority in the general elections that were held in April. The Hindu far right is famously patriarchal, and blind to the humanity and individuality of women.\\n\\n.\\n\\n> Take poet and novelist Meena Kandasamy. She writes about sexuality with a rare frankness, has over 25,000 followers on Twitter, and is a regular target of abuse. Speaking to me from Chennai, she said that the particular vulgarity of the tweets she is subjected to is influenced by the fact that she belongs to a low caste.\\n\\n.\\n\\n> “They want to frighten me off Twitter,” she told me. “They want me in a subjugated role.” **Top lel**\\n\\n.\\n\\n> The fact that a low caste woman could be seen as successful, not just by the standards of her community, but by the intellectual mainstream, is galling to caste-obsessed right-wing Hindu men. **ROTFLing @ her wishful fantasies**\\n\\n.\\n\\n> Sagarika Ghose, despite the fact that she has a TV show and a newspaper column where she can publicly call out abusers if she chooses to. “I regularly receive rape threats,” she told me. “I’m regularly called a whore and a slut who sleeps with “Congi” (Congress) politicians and every day my timeline is filled with abuses like ‘ass licker,’ ‘slave,’ and ‘Congress sepoy’ [foot soldier].” **What did she expect? People will thank her for calling them Nazis and murderers? Lulz**\\n\\n> Ghose shrugs off the abuse. “They’re playing out some perverse patriarchal fantasies of dominating strong women.”\\n\\n> Though right-wing Hindu men seem to be the majority of abusers on Twitter, just as they are the majority of people on the ground in India, their tweets suggest a profound sense of victimization. They portray themselves as a sort of endangered species whose survival depends on extinguishing, if only verbally, the people who are different from them. **Can\\'t you see the hilariously transparent agenda of the article? Lulz**\\n\\n> Not all women have suffered the onslaught. Right-wing women are protected from the abuse, earning relative freedom by prodding liberal women—even those who don’t follow them or even know who they are—in growling packs, attacking them like some children strike animals with sticks and stones. **There you go. Its not about women. Its about these phony left-wing propaganda machines getting as good as they give.**\\n\\nThis is nothing but a bunch of left-wing moonbats engaging in a cringeworthy display of attacking the Indian voters who just handed them a historic electoral spanking. \\n\\nThis is pure desperation. This is comic relief.\\n\\nFor better or for worse, we no longer live in an era of uni-directional media. The likes of Roy, Ghose, etc can no longer get away by calling people \"Nazis\", \"genocidal maniacs\", and \"murderers\" without getting a few choice abuses returned by the targets of their vicious propaganda.\\n\\nAnd when people return their compliments, they go whining about MUH PATRIARCHY, MUH HINDOOO-RIGHT-WING.

Before I got laid for the first time I had read a fair amount about sex. I took Sex Education classes in school. I read articles on positions and techniques in Maxim and Cosmo. I read sites like www.sexuality.org. I read the Savage Love column every week. I also looked at tons of porn on the internet and through my PlayStation 2's handy DVD player. All in all, I thought even though I had never done it myself, I knew most of what there was to know about sex.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThen I started having it and I kept discovering all these basic things that had somehow passed me by. In all the stuff I read and watched these things never came up. I never heard anyone talking about them either. I guess they assumed that the audience was already having sex and that knowing these things was a given. And it seems that porn glosses some things over or does not reflect what actual sex is like. I know, I'm as shocked as you are. So here's my list of basic sexual stuff that I only found out about when I came across it myself.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHopefully reading this will make life easier for the virgins out there in some way, you know, by lessening that fear of the unknown or whatever. I think the most common theme below is that sex is not as glamorous as it's sometimes made out to be. However, 'not glamorous' isn't the same as 'not enjoyable'. Sex is awesome. If anything, all the little quirks I'll mention below make it more fun.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Positions**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nFrom reading and watching porn I thought positions like missionary, doggy style, woman-on-top, etc. were simple, cut-and-dry things. I soon found out that each one has tons of subtle variations based on things like how you position your legs, the position of her legs, how deep inside her you are in a resting position, the angle you're thrusting in, the position of your upper body, how high or low your hips are on her body, how your bodies fit together, and so on and so on.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWith some variations her vagina will seem like a straight tunnel that you can easily go in-and-out, in-and-out of. With other variations you're mostly inside her, can only thrust a little, and you're more grinding pelvises together.  \\n\\nFor example, if you're in the missionary position:\\n\\n* If you put your legs together and straight back, you'll get a different feeling then if you had them spread out to your sides and had your knees further up on the bed.\\n* If she spreads her legs you'll be able to thrust in one way. If she lifts them up and wraps them behind your back, you'll be able to thrust deeper.\\n* If you rest on your elbows you'll enter her at one angle and be able to thrust in a certain way. If you straighten your arms and rest on your hands you'll thrust at a different angle.\\n* If the top of your hip bone roughly matches up with hers you'll get a certain angle and depth. If you try to 'ride higher' you'll get a different angle and depth.\\n* If your upper body is parallel to hers things'll go one way. If you raise your torso up to around 45 degrees things'll be slightly different.\\n* What works one way with a petite girl may not feel the same with a girl who's closer to your height.\\n* The idea is you have to play around with these variations in position to find a way that feels good for both of you (or just you if you're selfish).\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Vaginal lubrication**\\n\\nYou probably know that the vagina secretes a natural lubricant and that women get 'wet'. I knew that basic fact too, but I learned some more things about the process firsthand.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* It runs out at some point and she'll get dry, and eventually uncomfortable, during sex. Sometimes you have to pull out and apply some lube. At other times you can keep going for a bit and she'll get wet again.\\n* If the girl gets too wet during sex it can reduce the friction to the point where you don't really feel anything. If she's too dry it doesn't feel that great for you either.\\n* If enough of it accumulates it has a whitish, mayonnaise look to it. Sometimes you'll finish having sex and when you pull out and look down you'll see a big drop of it running down between her legs.\\n* If you're going at in the missionary position, it may run out on to the bed and leave a wet spot on the sheets that's a bit white when it dries.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Erections**\\n\\nIf you watch porn you may wonder why the guy's erection is sometimes slow to grow. You're thinking that if you were in his shoes you'd be as hard as a rock in a second.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* Nope, the same thing will happen to you. Once the intial thrill of hooking up with this girl/girls in general wears off, your erection will often start to get soft when your penis isn't being directly stimulated.\\n* Being drunk, being distracted, and bad technique on the girl's part can contribute to your not getting it up quickly.\\n* After putting on a condom you may need to jerk yourself off for a second to get it a bit harder before you stick it in her.\\n* If it's not hard enough you'll have a hard time putting it in. It'll tend to bend or slide out of the way instead of penetrating. However, if it's slightly soft and you manage to get in it, you can often get it harder quickly once you start thrusting.\\n* If the sex isn't great and/or you're distracted and/or something messed up happens you may start to go soft once you're inside her.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Sticking it in**\\n\\nYou've probably heard jokes about this before. Yep, it can be hard to find the hole. Even if you know where you need to go visually, the vaginal entrance can be smaller and tighter than you think so you may not feel exactly where you need to insert the tip of your penis.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* With missionary it's fairly obvious where you need to put it, but if you're trying to guide it in blind then it can be awkward.\\n* With doggy style the hole is further up then you'd think.\\n* When the girl is on top the angle of her vaginal tunnel can give you problems and you can't really see what you're doing. It's best if she guides it in herself.\\n* Like I said above, if you're a bit soft then you can have trouble putting it in.\\n* If you fail to get it in properly your dick will slide somewhere else and may feel like it's in for a second or two.\\n* All this is more difficult if you have a condom on, as it's harder to feel what you're doing.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Climaxing**\\n\\nYou may also watch porn and wonder why the guy sometimes has to jerk off for a few minutes before delivering the money shot. You're thinking if you were in that position you'd pop off no problem.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* Again, the same thing may happen to you. Sometimes you'll be having sex/getting a blowjob/jerking off and you won't be able to cum. If the stimulation isn't effective it can happen. If you put too much pressure on yourself to orgasm on demand it can happen.\\n* The more common stereotype is that men finish too quickly and that they have to think about stuff like baseball in order to last any real length of time. But not being able to cum happens too. Not all guys are losers who are done in thirty seconds. Finishing too soon definitely happens, but not every single time.\\n* In many cases you're not just going to cum instantly as soon as you start pounding away, you have to find the speed, angle, depth, etc. that feels good for you. It's not automatic, just like you can't just masturbate in any random way. You have to do what's effective for you.\\n* On a related note, women don't always want to have marathon sex sessions. Sometimes they'll get tired of the guy stabbing away endlessly, especially if it's not doing anything for them. Sometimes they'll start to get dry and sore. Sometimes they'll have an orgasm or two and think that's enough. Sometimes they'll just be happy with a good twenty minutes of fun sex and not have any need to go for longer.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Minor injuries**\\n\\n* It can be irritating to your skin when your sweaty pubic hair rubs against hers.\\n* Someone's hair my get accidentally pulled or caught.\\n* Someone may clumsily fall over as you're changing positions (e.g., when she's getting off you from being on top, when you try to transition from missionary with you kneeling and her laying down to missionary with both of you laying down).\\n* You may hit your head against the headboard, har har har.\\n* When you're going at it missionary style you can end up hitting the bottom of your bladder on her pelvic bone. That gets old after ten minutes...\\n* Your knees and elbows can get sore after a while from rubbing on the bed/floor/etc.\\n* During doggy style if you slip out and then accidently thrust back into her pelvis. This can hurt the tip of your dick.\\n* If she's riding you and you slip out she can come down on your dick. Usually it gets bent a little and hurts for a minute. At the worst you can rupture the tissue and take a trip to the hospital.\\n* You may get scratches, bruises, pulled hair (purposely this time), and bite marks. That's cool.\\n* You may fall off the bed or hit your elbow against the wall or something else like that. You just gotta laugh when this shit happen.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Condoms**\\n\\nFirst let me say that you should always wear these things despite what I say below. You know what can happen if you don't. You may have heard guys complain about condoms, saying they kill the mood or whatever. It's true, they are kind of annoying.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* They kill spontaneity. You can't smoothly progress from foreplay to sex. You have to stop the action to go grab a condom, open it, and then put it on.\\n* They smell bad.\\n* They kill sensation, sometimes to the point where you can barely feel your own dick inside the girl. On the plus side, they can allow you to last longer.\\n* Sometimes when you're inside the girl they'll bunch up in weird ways and feel strange.\\n* They interrupt the flow of things after sex is over. You have to pull out, take the condom off, and get rid of it.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Messiness**\\n\\nYou probably know this already, but overall sex is messier than what you see on t.v. or in porn.\\n\\n* You're going to get hot and sweaty of course.\\n* The woman's lubrication is going to dribble all over the place and possibly stain the sheets. Someone is going to get semen on them at some point. Condom wrappers are going to litter the ground. You may kiss passionately and slobber all over each other.\\n* Someone may let out a fart right in the middle of things.\\n* Sometimes when you pull out and she changes positions she'll fart out her vagina (queefing).\\n* If you finger her your fingers may be covered with a lot of her clear lubricant when you pull them out. You may have to wipe them off on your leg or something. Classy.\\n* If you have sex when she's on her period, well use your imagination.\\n* If you have anal sex you may get some poo on your dick.\\n* If you have a good session, when you're done you're going to be sweaty, red faced, tired, and a bit out of it. Your hair will be messed up, gross stray hairs will be stuck to your skin, the girl will have a bit of white lubricant running out of her cootch. You'll have a bit of cum dribbling out of your dick. There will be at least one condom wrapper on the floor, the sheets and pillows will be all over the place, and the bed will have a wet spot on it. If you cuddle afterwards you'll start to stick together and it'll feel gross when you pull apart. It's great.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**General differences from masturbation and porn**\\n\\nIf I had to give a simplified summary I'd say masturbating is all about the visuals while actual sex is more about physical feelings. Of course masturbation is about the physical feelings too, but if you're anything like me, the visuals drive the experience and provide most of the excitement. When you're using your imagination you keep flipping between different scenarios until you hit on one that does it for you. When you watch porn you probably skip around between different DVD scenes or online clips until you hit on one that turns you on the most.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWith sex some positions give you something to look at, but you're hardly sitting in a chair watching a scene that has been shot from a distance and angle that gives you a good view. If you're doing a girl in the missionary position you're too close to her to see anything. Your eyes are probably closed, or if they're open they may not be focused on anything. You're probably kissing her or you may have your head nuzzled in her neck. Cut off from the visuals you instead concentrate on the tactile sensations; your dick going in and out of her vagina, your bodies pressed together, her hands scratching your back, her breath on your cheek, how hot you are, the sweat forming on the small of your back, your hands grabbing her boobs, kissing, and various little aches, tired spots, and discomforts. And then there are the sounds and smells; body parts slapping together, her breathing and moaning. The smell of latex, sweat, someone's breath, or her vag.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nOf course, sometimes when you're going at it you'll be picturing things in your head to help yourself get off. Like maybe your girlfriend is going down on you and that feels pretty nice, but not quite perfect, so you imagine a porn scene or hot girl you saw the other day to get yourself over the edge.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAlso, when you watch porn you can mistakingly associate the visual act you're witnessing with the sensations you're giving yourself. For example, say you have a thing for titty fucking scenes in porn. And let's say as you're watching, you're masturbating in a fast, intense manner. You know your body so of course it's going to feel good. But actual titty fucking probably doesn't feel like your fast, intense, just-right wanking. The true physical sensations may or may not be your cup of tea. You may find them too slow or soft for your tastes and be disappointed in the real thing. Here's another example: Maybe when you watch porn you really like the reverse cowgirl position (girl on top facing away from the guy). As a third party observer this position gives you something to look at. But when you're actually the guy all you see is the girl's back and, again, the sensations of her riding you aren't the same as the just-right wanking feelings you gave yourself when you were watching two other people doing it.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Some more observations about how real sex differs from porn and the movies**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* Obviously in real life it's a lot more sweaty, clumsy, grunty, and primal than dramatic Hollywood love scenes make it out to be.\\n* In porn the positions are all about making the sex visable to the camera and to give you a good look at the woman's body. In real life concerns such as being close to each other often take precedence.\\n* Personally I've never had sex under the sheets. They just get in the way.\\n* Personally I think having sex with all your clothes on kind of sucks (it's a bit awkward and skin on skin contact feels so much better), but you see it all the time in movies and t.v. shows (e.g., The Sopranos). Of course they've got other, more practical, reasons for portraying it like this.\\n* What amuses me in movies now is what you could call the 'instant penetration.' You see it all the time if you look for it. A man and woman will be in their underwear, or even fully clothed, in some sexually charged situation. Maybe the woman is sitting on the man's lap (both in their underwear remember), or the man is standing behind the woman. The camera is focused on their faces. Then the guy will make a little movement, the woman will gasp, and then they'll close their eyes and start moaning, the implication being that the man achieved vaginal penetration off-camera. Yeah, not that quick and easy in real life. You've got to move your clothes out of the way, line things up, the guy has to be hard enough, the woman needs to be pretty wet, and often the man has to guide his penis in with his hand.

I am really bad at typing these paragraphs but I will give it a go. \\n\\nFor the past few months, I have been thinking about this a lot. India has been a very terrible experience for me. I live in Chandigarh which is considered to be one of the most developed cities in our country which is a joke, this city is terrible when compared to the cities in the western countries. The rest of India is way worse, when a person who lives in one of the most \"developed\" cities of a country says that the city is very bad due to the infrastructure available then that\\'s a real shame for the government. There\\'s not a single thing I like about this country (except for the food, I love it) at all, I read the news daily in hopes of reading something which shows that our country is finally developing but no, all I see is news that depresses the hell out of me. The worst thing is that this news doesn\\'t even show the full picture, many things still happen and we don\\'t even know about them at all. Fine, every country has their secrets, so does India. No matter where I go, all I see is filth and terrible infrastructure. I cringe whenever my relatives and friends say \"Hey, look, a new house is being constructed! Development!\" I am not sure if this happens with everybody else. I am not an expert at this but if a house is being built in a place with the worst infrastructure possible, that doesn\\'t mean development. Instead, you\\'re making the situation worse because it would have to be destroyed for constructing something (in case that happens which is impossible). India\\'s government is one of the most inefficient governments I have ever seen, getting work done here is a blessing. I see people posting on this subreddit thinking their opinions actually matter (I know whatever I am saying is an opinion too but I wanted to let it all out), people sending e-mails to TRAI, etc. thinking there will be a change. Even if there\\'s a change, will it make our country any better to be honest? Most redditors here think that they\\'re different from the rest of the country, let me tell you, it\\'s the contrary. All I see is stupid arguments about governments, Modi, Arvind Kejrival, etc. which doesn\\'t help us in anyway. You are literally spending an hour arguing with a person you will never meet in real life. Even if you do win the argument, will it really make any difference? \\n\\nMy blood boils whenever I see a poor person on the streets because I am unable to help him/her, there are millions of these people. Hell, even we are poor when compared to the people in the western countries. I look at China and see how much they have developed and look at where India is, it\\'s a huge shame for the government. I always notice false hope in the news, people keep living in India thinking that the country will change in a good way, no, it won\\'t. At least not in a couple of decades (I am being extremely optimist here), there would have to be a huge change in the way how the government works to actually achieve any important infrastructural development. I don\\'t really understand why people say that India is diverse and then say it is a good thing. Yes, people from different religions living in a country is a nice thing but do you see what\\'s happening in India? Bloodshed, I would rather live a country with just one religion than a country with 5-6 religions, it only leads to conflicts.\\nThe education system in India is an absolute joke, all I see is students cheating recklessly to score marks and even if they do, they don\\'t succeed in their lives. It\\'s all about the theory, many of my relatives didn\\'t know how to do a job because they just used to cram books. The worst thing I have seen is that whenever we refer to India (before 1947), we forget about Pakistan and Bangladesh. They were also a part of the independence struggle but nowadays, I even see the educated folks insulting them. Just because they\\'re now in a different country? I still consider them Indian, I go to various sites and I see people mocking Pakistan. Many of my relatives are still in Pakistan and I am from Pakistan myself (I am a Sikh). It just feels really bad when I see everybody insulting the people of our own country, the ones of the same origin as us. \\n\\nThis may sound a  bit far-fetched but Pakistan and India are the same for me, not because of the culture or anything but because of the violence. It doesn\\'t matter how people die, whether they die in terrorist attacks or andolans (protests), people are still dying. My great-grandmother used to say that India will once be as developed as the western countries. Well, I will have to say that she would have been extremely disappointed if she was still alive. I often travel to cities like Amritsar, Jalandhar, etc. and I see that many of the buildings are there since the time of independence, they\\'re still in the same condition. India is changing, you are correct about that but in a bad way (infrastructure-wise at the very least). Okay, let\\'s say that I should forget about the infrastructure, we still need to improve a lot when it comes to our own homes. The internet speed is terrible, the power-cuts and brownouts are terrible, the water is terrible, there\\'s nothing good to point out. If India really wants to change then we will have to destroy a lot of buildings, etc. and start from scratch, all of these houses which are being built feel temporary to me because they don\\'t constitute development at all. The road in front of my house is a 2-lane road, whenever people come to our house, they are shocked to see such a wide road. This thing alone makes me very sad because people in the western countries are used to having a 4-lane road (or more) in front of their houses.\\nThis world isn\\'t fair at all, what did I do to deserve to be born in such a country? I know I am offending everybody but this is the truth. We are all helpless, there\\'s nothing we can do. People keep chanting \"Swacch Bharat!\" but it doesn\\'t mean anything because picking up a few packets of Kurkure, Lays chips, etc. which are lying on a really poorly built road won\\'t help much.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, India will stay the same, even if it does change, it will take a lot of time and I\\'d rather not spend that time in this country. I am going abroad as quickly as I can but I don\\'t think I can because my parents don\\'t want to leave India.

Of course the views shown in documentary which reflect the thought process of a major section of the society, not limited to any religion. It really is an \"Indian\" problem.

The whole new generation of the youngsters on the social media, the impatient Gen Y of the country who think that they have a progressive world view but lack the most basic quality of progressive thinking, the thirst of fact finding. The generation is too quick to build opinions without doing some fact check at all.\\n\\nWhat I want to discuss here is the point two.\\n\\nWhere are we headed? In what direction are we taking the next generation?\\n\\nAll the hoopla around the documentary ban was marketed by irresponsible media houses as government\\'s feeble attempt to save its face.\\n\\nWas the documentary worth broadcast and put in public domain? Yes, definitely yes.\\n\\nWas the ban on the documentary imposed for the reason as propagated by media houses and widely spread on social media by our progressive next generation? No, definitely no.\\n\\nThe documentary ban was not because of the content. No matter which politician said what on what television channel about it is secondary, but what was the official stance of the government behind the broadcast ban? What did my country\\'s Home Minister have to say about it? What did the \"democratically elected government\"have to say about the reason for the ban?\\n\\nThe official stance of the government can be read here: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=116442\\n\\nNow I want to simply state that on one hand, we cry out loud about creating stricter laws and better enforcement to fight the evil of rape prevalent in our society but do we have the decency to respect our existing laws? Did we respect the term and conditions which were laid down by the OUR Home Ministry and OUR Jail Administration to a FOREIGN NATIONAL? Did we respect the sanctity of the rules created by our constitution? The answer in its entirety is a big NO.\\n\\nWe abused and mocked our government for banning the documentary without trying to know the reason behind it. We shielded a foreign national who worked around the rules and regulations created under the limitations of the constitution of India to protect the sovereignty of our nation. We valued words of a person with god knows what agenda above the words of our government.\\n\\nI really feel sorry to say that I am an Indian today, not because of what documentary had shown -- most of us already knew about how society thinks as most of us know at least 20 people who carry the same stance as the people who are being shown in the documentary in our social circles. I am sorry because how gullible we are and how we made a nobody overnight famous and made ourselves cash cow of the same imperialists, who robbed and looted and sucked the life out of country for 200 years.\\n\\nPlease grow up. Stop seeing everything as black & white. Use your rationale and don\\'t believe everything the media tells you. We have glorified a stooge who had no value for our sovereignty. We glorified a channel which had no value for our laws and our constitution.

No doubt that rape is very disgusting, unfair and sickening but we can\\'t forget that India is still trying to recover culturally from invasions by Islam and England that lasted over centuries with traumatic damage to its inherent reasoning, economy and physical landscape. It is a post-colonial society.\\n\\nThe Muslims were especially terrible on the North side of India (where the brutal rape occurred) and they had a habit of enslaving and treating people with general disrespect so Indians adapted a more defensive tone against their women for protection, thus birthing the oppressive instinct lingering ever since on the north side. Indian women have become more liberal recently however (More power to them!) and the brutal rape was a terrible reaction by the four idiots in Delhi to their perceptions of freedom which was considered taboo or insulting in the north side. I\\'m truly happy that two of the rapists have been put to death and the last two will be soon. Indian women have been known to enjoy more openness in society towards the South of India because the Muslims did not invade that far and denigrate the culture.\\n\\nIndia was also made extremely poor by the British and they wreaked havoc on the social fabric of the entire subcontinent by creating motivations for the caste system and turning the different clans against one another while justifying it as a rigid vertical hierarchy (which it originally was not) with bigger rewards for those at the top. Plus England was responsible for the British East India Tea company and as a whole, they looted the entire continent of its resources and then used that money to further colonize the rest of the world to our chagrin today... India was not called Britain\\'s crown jewel for no reason! And yes, the British East Tea company was supposedly run by a psychopath. \\n\\nMy final point is that India is still trying to recover (as it has many times before) from the negative aspects of its colonial history and its lingering side effects but Indians are still making progress in their own right. If Indians and everyone else would actually look further back throughout its history; then they would see India\\'s amazing proto-cultural, intellectual and proto-spiritual developments that have existed even before the first monotheistic faith (Zoroastianism) stepped foot on the Earth. In other words, India is still the enduring legacy of an ancient civilization crucial to world development; and no, it did not get there by disrespecting it\\'s women- it was however an arbiter of trade in the silk roads, invented the number 0 in mathematics and calculated the age of our planet as billions of years old (similar to modern scientific thought) when no one else even considered such things. It is also the place and culture where yoga and meditation came into existence that we enjoy today in the west so please don\\'t judge India or Indians based on any British perspective about rape because England has already enslaved and pillaged the majority of the world\\'s cultural identity and resources (which is also a form of rape if you truly think about it...)\\n\\nPlease don\\'t misunderstand though, rape is not OK and there is a need for a continuing line of Indian progress/recovery within its own country but Britain does not deserve the right to evoke an isolated emotional reaction in absence of the objective world history that it has negatively contributed to in terms of culture; so please research everything, don\\'t fall for emotional propaganda and always keep questioning!\\n\\nLet the truth prevail...\\n(Share if you need).\\n\\n\\n**P.S.

He never stalked a women, never commented on a women, no booing, no cat calling even before meeting his first and last love Preeti.

Although 37 million persons left agriculture during the periods 2004-05 and 2011-12, they found work in non-agricultural activities, both rural and urban. In comparison, 20 million new workers joined agriculture between 1999-2004.\\n\\n- Agriculture has grown much faster since 2005. In fact, during the 11th Plan, agricultural output grew at 3.2 per cent per annum (2007-12) on average, despite crippling drought in 2009-10 and despite the number of people leaving agriculture.  \\n- The reduction of people working in agricultural work is the first time in our history.   \\n- Services jobs grew by 11 million, and manufacturing employment increased by a remarkable nine million in two years alone (2009-10 and 2011-12), although manufacturing employment fell in absolute terms by three million between 2004-05 and 2009-10. \\n\\n- For the first time in the history of India, there was a decline in the absolute numbers of the poor after 2004-05; until then for nearly 30 years (1973-74 to 2004-5), there was a fall in the percentage, but not in the absolute numbers of the poor (322 million poor in 1973-74 and 302 million poor in 2004-05, by the Lakdawala poverty line). The decline in poverty was driven by a rise in real wages.  \\n- The new non-poor demand simple manufactured consumer goods: processed food (biscuits, milk), leather goods (shoes, sandals), furniture (plastic chairs/tables, wooden furniture), textiles, garments and mobiles. All these product areas and services saw a dramatic increase in employment between 2009-10 and 2011-12, primarily because these simple, low-end products (at least those consumed by the new non-poor) are produced in the unorganised sector, using labour-intensive methods.\\n\\nhttp://archive.financialexpress.com/news/column-the-myth-of-jobless-growth/1099529/1 [ Article from Apr 2013 ]\\n\\n-  It is inconceivable that such a massive increase in GDP (over four times) can take place without commensurate growth in employment, yet the government of India persists with this myth.

So please don't downvote and kill this thread without even reading. \\nPlease convince me and tell me where I am going wrong. \\n\\n\\n\\nI see nothing wrong in prohibiting women or men in a particular temple or mosque or church. Or in certain sections of said mosque church temple. \\n\\n\\n\\n--Hinduism is made of thousands of different sects, belief systems, ideas etc so much so that if anyone tries to limit it to a set of beliefs like the RSS or. BJP sometimes do.. They will be in the wrong. \\n\\n\\n-- This particular sect States that the deity is a celibate and does not want to come in contact with fertile women.\\n\\nWhy should it matter that it is stupid or intelligent or smart or foolish. \\n\\nIt is a belief. All religious beliefs are man made and stupid according to me. But people are free to believe whatever they want to. This is religious freedom. \\n\\n-- As long as nobody is imposing their beliefs on others, and the belief is not causing harm to others...\\nWe should respect it. We can critique it if we want to. But we shouldn't impose our own belief system onto others forcefully. \\n\\n\\n-- Now somebody will say that this prohibition is causing harm to women. How? \\n\\n\\nIf you are a genuine devotee of Lord Ayappa or whatever the lords name is.. And you believe in this particular sect. You will believe that he doesn't want to come in contact with women. So why would any women want to do what the lord specifically did not want them to do. It is like a jain person doing animal sacrifice. Going completely against the basic tenet of the sect. \\n\\n\\nThat is why no women believing in the sect wants to go there.\\n\\n\\nAnd if you don't like this sect and its prohibition of visiting the deity in the temple, then change your sect, change your religion, become atheist...do whatever you want. \\n\\n\\nAnd I don't see any harm if you don't get to go to this particular temple where the deity specifically wishes you not come. \\n\\n\\nGo to other temples man. Or pray from the base of the temple or whatever. \\n\\n\\n-- But what if I want to reform the religion, one might ask. I want to have a lord ayappa sect which welcomes women to touch the deity and take selfies with deity etc etc. Or whatever reform one wants to have. \\n\\n\\nSo start your own temple. Your own sect. Nobody is stopping you. If somebody stops you, then they will be wrong, and I will fight for your right to your religious freedom. \\n\\n\\nStart your own lord ayappa sect and add many other idols of women around it. Make it only for women. Do whatever it is that you want to. Preach your new sect. \\n\\n\\nFor example- Homosexuality is prohibited in all abrahamic religions. \\nA gay person cannot become the leader of a mosque or a church (technically).\\n\\n\\nYou cannot force Delhi Jama Masjid or Kalkaji Church to allow a gay person to become the imam or the pastor who will lead the prayer. This is against religious freedom. \\n\\n\\nBut at the same time, gay Muslims and Christians can open up lgbt mosques and churches and welcome all people there. \\n\\n\\nGay Imam in LGBT friendly mosque in South Africa \\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-lgbt-religion-idUSKCN1PU0J9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- Forcing your own belief systems onto religious sects and beliefs is wrong and stupid. \\n\\n\\nIf there is a bali sect among Hindus where goats and cattle are sacrificed, it is improper for other vegetarian Hindus to force them to stop their balis. \\n\\n\\nAnd more so for the judiciary to meddle into the affairs of religion. \\n\\n\\nYou can try and reform. You can try and convince. You can start your own counter sect.

The average penis size of us Indians is below 4 inches. So Bhai damn sure had to have a bigger dick than the rest of us. I mean, he needs it to slap his co-stars with it!\\n\\nSo I went and googled images of Bhai. And if you see here in this [album](http://imgur.com/a/9tHW2), you'll see that Bhai always has a bulge. It means that he has a big dick and is not just a *shower* but also a *grower*. \\n\\nWho else has a bulge like him?

It typifies my mood: I truly feel a growing sense of impotent rage. Intolerance has always existed in this country, only never before has extremism been legitimised so brazenly by powerful sections of society. A man is lynched in Dadri and very few truly empathise with the grief of a poor family. Instead, rabble rousers continue to pursue their agenda to decide on what people should eat: the obvious aim is to stir a Hindu Muslim divide. Ink is thrown at a public figure, a music concert of one the greatest ghazal singers is stalled: the debate isn't about free artistic expression but becomes about who is 'patriotic' and who is not. Sahitya Akademi award winners return their awards and their right to dissent is not accepted; instead, they are abused and targeted as 'pseudo-intellectuals'. The new buzzword is 'selective outrage': if you didn't outrage about a crime against a Hindu you have no moral right to outrage when a Muslim is killed. Killings it seems have become a zero sum game: your riot versus mine. We don't spare anyone who might wish to break from the official narrative that seeks to promote majoritarianism in the garb of silencing all those who might insist on a greater reach out to the more vulnerable minority groups. When Naseeruddin Shah, arguably the finest stage actor of our generation, says he is being made conscious of his Muslim identity for the first time, being dubbed 'anti national' for attending a seminar, you wonder what kind of a civil society are we bequeathing to the next generation.

In the public arena of course they can spin lies after lies to defend their actions. But here, on /r/india, in the presence of educated knowledgeable Indians, pseudo\"seculars\" can simply not defend any of their beliefs or actions.\\n\\nI call this the beginning of the end of \"secular\" nonsense in India. As more people in India get educated and knowledgeable (about the true nature of pseudo\"secular\"ism, commie nonsense, about the hatred in the books of the Abrahamics, etc.) they will easily see the double standards and lies and dismiss psec ideas from polite thought and company.\\n\\nGood job center and center-right Indians/Hindus on /r/india. There is light at the end of the tunnel. :-)', '', 'Though I live in India since long, there are still some points that I find hard to understand – for example why many educated Indians become agitated when India is considered as a Hindu country. The majority of Indians are Hindus. India is special because of its ancient Hindu tradition. Westerners are drawn to India because of it. Why then is there this resistance by many Indians to acknowledge the Hindu roots of their country?\\n\\nThis attitude is strange for two reasons. First, those educated Indians seem to have a problem only with ‘Hindu’ India, but not with ‘Muslim’ or ‘Christian’ countries. In Germany for example, only 59 percent of the population are registered with the two big Christian Churches (Protestant and Catholic), however, the country is bracketed under ‘Christian countries’. Angela Merkel, the Chancellor, stressed recently the Christian roots of Germany and urged the population ‘to go back to Christian values’. In 2012, she postponed her trip to the G-8 summit for a day to address the German Catholic Day. Two major political parties carry ‘Christian’ in their name, including Angela Merkel’s ruling party.\\n\\nGermans are not agitated that Germany is called a Christian country, though I actually would understand if they were. After all, the history of the Church is appalling. The so called success story of Christianity depended greatly on tyranny. “Convert or die”, were the options given not only to the indigenous population in America some five hundred years ago. In Germany, too, 1200 years ago, the emperor Karl the Great ordered the death sentence for refusal of baptism in his newly conquered realms. It provoked his advisor Alkuin to comment: ‘One can force them to baptism, but how to force them to believe?’\\n\\nThose times, when one’s life was in danger if one dissented with the dogmas of the Church, are thankfully over. And nowadays many in the west do dissent and leave the Church in a steady stream – partly because they are disgusted with the less than holy behavior of Church officials and partly because they can’t believe in the dogmas, for example that ‘Jesus is the only way’ and that God sends all those who don’t accept this to hell.\\n\\nAnd here comes the second reason why the resistance to associate India with Hinduism by Indians is difficult to understand. Hinduism is in a different category from the Abrahamic religions. Its history, compared to Christianity and Islam was undoubtedly the least violent as it spread in ancient times by convincing arguments and not by force. It is not a belief system that demands blind belief in dogmas and the suspension of one’s intelligence. On the contrary, Hinduism encourages using one’s intelligence to the hilt. It is an enquiry into truth, based on a refined (methods are given) character and intellect. It comprises a huge body of ancient literature, not only regarding Dharma and philosophy, but also regarding music, architecture, dance, science, astronomy, economics, politics, etc. If Germany or any other western country had this kind of literary treasure, it would be so proud and highlight its greatness on every occasion. When I discovered for example the Upanishads, I was stunned. Here was expressed in clear terms what I intuitively had felt to be true, but could not have expressed clearly. Brahman is not partial; it is the invisible, indivisible essence in everything. Everyone gets again and again a chance to discover the ultimate truth and is free to choose his way back to it. Helpful hints are given but not imposed.\\n\\nIn my early days in India, I thought that every Indian knew and valued his tradition. Slowly I realized that I was wrong. The British colonial masters had been successful in not only weaning away many of the elite from their ancient tradition but even making them despise it. It helped that the ‘educated’ class could no longer read the original Sanskrit texts and believed what the British told them. This lack of knowledge and the brainwashing by the British education may be the reason why many ‘modern’ Indians are against anything ‘Hindu’. They don’t realize the difference between western religions that have to be believed (or at least professed) blindly, and which discourage if not forbid their adherents to think on their own and the multi-layered Hindu Dharma which gives freedom and encourages using one’s intelligence.\\n\\nMany of the educated class do not realize that on one hand, westerners, especially those who dream to impose their own religion on this vast country, will applaud them for denigrating Hindu Dharma, because this helps western universalism to spread in India. On the other hand, many westerners, including Church people, very well know the value and surreptitiously appropriate insights from the vast Indian knowledge system, drop the original source and present it either as their own or make it look as if these insights had been known in the west.\\n\\nRajiv Malhotra of Infinity Foundation has done painstaking research in this field and has documented many cases of “digestion” of Dharma civilization into western universalism. He chose the term digestion, as it implies that that which is being digested (a deer for example) is in the end no longer there, whereas the ‘digester’ (a tiger) becomes stronger. Similarly, Hindu civilization is gradually being depleted of its valuable, exclusive assets and what is left is called inferior.\\n\\nIf only missionaries denigrated Hindu Dharma, it would not be so bad, as they clearly have an agenda which discerning Indians would detect. But sadly, Indians with Hindu names assist them because they wrongly believe that Hinduism is inferior to western religions. They belittle everything Hindu instead of getting thorough knowledge. As a rule, they know little about their tradition except what the British told them, i.e. that the major features are caste system and idol worship. They don’t realize that India would gain, not lose, if it solidly backed its profound and all inclusive Hindu tradition. The Dalai Lama said some time ago that already as a youth in Lhasa, he had been deeply impressed by the richness of Indian thought. “India has great potential to help the world,” he added. When will the westernized Indian elite realize it?\\n\\n-Article by Mariawirth : May 4, 2013', \"*  Paid sex does not count.\\n\\n*  Imaginary sex also doesn't count.\\n\\nI will begin.

I am an Indian ,Hindu(\"forward caste\" )  woman who settled in USA for last 20 years. I love my home country as much as USA, so no prejudice in my observation.\\n\\nI have observed that the thought analyses of so called educated Indians is far less than Americans. I am beginning to wonder if we have lesser IQ(currently). My theory is stemmed from the following :\\n\\n1. We never came out of our communal sentiments (caste based) even though we are aware it is all nonsense . We never even try to address it within ourselves nor we read extensively about its origins in school. Most general population never wonder why do we have \"classes\" within the same race? It is peculiar that communal sentiment is stronger than National sentiment. People actively participate in these sentiments.\\n2. We submit too much to \"gurus\" without making thorough investigation of them. We support their pseudo science because it protects our insecurities . We are fine with them occupying lands, controlling wealth , preaching enormous ignorance . They give lame explanations of effect of Saturn on some temples and why women should don\\'t enter them. We never question the science behind it.\\n3. Our theatre arts (cinema ) is at its worst. We are such snowflakes that directors lives are threatened if they take movies that \"hurt\" communal sentiments. We don\\'t want to hear truths . Or alt least look at it and judge it ourselves without making a huge political stunts. And unfortunately people support it. They have to always distort the truth to please the audience. What kind of cowardice is that? What\\'s the purpose of the art?\\n4. There are no Science-fiction movies that can be thoughtful...like Inception, Martian or Interstallar . Most Indians don\\'t even discuss these movies, let alone produce them. I wonder how much of our population even understand them or want to watch them?\\n5. We read more of current day to day politics than any other books out there. Never try to understand to go and think beyond. There is more interest in vanity (flaunting their cars, assets ) than acquiring knowledge.\\n6. Very egoistic and arrogant  but surprisingly devotees of either politicians , gurus or heroes. Their bhakti is unmatched to any other world .\\n7. They hesitate to question anything ancient and sacred. Lack of analytical skills?....\\n8. Our politicians represent our moral sense and values.\\n9. They believe that being educated is reading bunch class text books and ace the exams. Parents are extremely proud of their kids achievements and very ashamed of those who are academically backward( I mean those who can\\'t boring drill for hours??)\\n10. They don\\'t even read  their scriptures but have a very high feeling of them. The question is they don\\'t read but yet they feel proud of it..\\n11. The list goes on.................', 'I don\\'t know whether this is gonna be controversial or not, so writing from a throwaway.\\n\\nWhat are the values of our constitution designed by people like Ambedkar upheld? Liberty, equality, fraternity and democracy (I am not including Socialist and Secular because right wingers say that it was Indira who pushed these words into it and that the original constitution didn\\'t have those). Basically they wanted to make India a progressive and modern country.\\n\\nNow, lets look at India (note, the following may apply to other countries but for the moment we are only concerned about India and its population) and its culture.\\n\\nFirstly, religion plays an EXTREMELY important role in our country. Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, etc are important and considered sensitive topics. Religions, by its nature, are regressive and anti-liberal. This becomes the first case that the \\'modernist\\' constitution isn\\'t fit for the people. Many liberal Hindus, Christians, Muslims, etc may defend, but anyone with knowledge about religions and comparative religions know that sexism, homophobia, racism, superstitions, etc form the basis of almost every religion.\\n\\nSecond, liberty. We all know our Indian \\'kulcha\\'. Do you think people really love liberty? Yes, people do love \\'political liberty\\' from other countries, like anti-imperialism and sovereignty, but do they love personal liberties? Does Indian culture allow for things like privacy, consent, independence, free thinking, etc? Do Indians in general give a damn? I am sorry, but I feel this just  isn\\'t true. Indians, in general, are NOT liberal in any way. Think about an average Indian household from any religion. Does that house respect \\'liberty\\'? Do they respect independent and rational thinking? Do they respect privacy of individuals? Do they respect women\\'s right to their own lives? Do they like sexual freedom at all? Do they respect homosexuality and trans people?\\n\\nThird, equality. Does Indian culture promote equality? The same religious culture which thinks women should wear \\'modest\\' clothes and that otherwise they should be raped? The same culture which thinks women should be in the kitchen and locked in the house serving her in-laws and the man should be earning their bread? The same culture which says transgenders and homosexuals are mentally ill people? Can our \\'religiously plural\\' culture, in which Hindus think other religions and non-religiousness is \\'adharmic\\', in which Muslims think non-believers are \\'kafirs\\', in which Christians think non-believers are \\'satans\\' really create an \\'equal\\' society (I am not talking about the liberal young Hindus, Muslims, etc in cities who visit Starbucks. I am talking about the orthodox ones which are far more common)? Can our culture which divides people into \\'castes\\' (or jaatis or Varnas whatever term they like) and reinforces those castes, upheld \\'equality\\'?\\n\\nThird democracy. Democracy means where people have the authority to choose their government. What democracy? A democracy in which people believe in people like Swami Nithyananda and Zakir Naik? In which a quarter of the people are illiterate, most people just vote out of party loyalty and where people don\\'t know which government did what? Where goons in poll booths rig elections and force people/threaten people to vote for their party? This democracy isn\\'t a functioning democracy to begin with. Many many people don\\'t have any clue about this democracy. A politician comes, gives provocative speeches in rallies, the public shouts and chants a slogan and then they vote for that party. Like it or not, our country is badly divided right now. People who support one side literally want the other side to be \\'killed\\'. And I am not talking only about the internet. There are many people who would love to see Gandhi \\'parivaar\\' rule for centuries just because they are \\'from Gandhi family\\' (like a king). Some people would love to see BJP ruling forever and implement authoritarianism. You think all these protests represent a lot of people? You are wrong. Out of 1.3 billion people, the protesting population is nothing. BJP supporters would love to see these protesters crushed and them to be jailed. There is no fraternity, nor is there any democracy here. If there is fascism or Stalinism, like it or not, many people in India will gladly accept that.\\n\\nMy point is, the current condition of the country is because the constitution, which was way ahead of its time and quite modern and liberal, was literally forced into the Indian population. That is why today you see the constitution breaking down, \\'secularism\\' breaking down, equality breaking down, conservatism taking hold of major positions - because India isn\\'t being able to digest the constitution. For example, our constitution is, I can say, moderately \\'feminist\\'. It gives equal rights to men and women and allows them to live their independent lives, to grow and become mature and independent adults. Tell me, is the same sentiment there in Indian families? Does the constitution prevent a man from beating his daughter and marrying her off as soon as she turns 18? Does the constitution prevent the father from telling his sons that women are \\'second class citizens who belong in the kitchen\\'? No. And that is the problem. The constitution puts a top-down pressure on people to be feminist while the bottom up pressure for a social change is and was totally absent since the time when constitution was formed. That is why, even though the constitution is, in a way, \\'feminist\\', you won\\'t see its effect in your daily life. You friends will spew out sexist jokes, your parents and family elders will tell you that women are homemakers, etc. because the social change has always been from the top - the government - but never in our society. The constitution was designed by intellectuals who dreamed of a better and modern India, and sadly Indian people in general do not share the same sentiments. What we are currently seeing around the world, especially in India is that people are going back in time to those ancient morals and society because mentally it never had the capability to become modern, to become liberal, to become equal, to be a single fraternity.\\n\\nSorry for being so pessimistic, but I feel the constitution, with its liberalism, secularism, equality, etc was unnecessarily forced upon Indians. Indian society was never fit for such a constitution. In short, the sentence \"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to...\" written in the constitution is false. Most Indian people never agreed with the constitution in the first place. And that is why you are seeing the constitution fall. I remember a BJP member saying \"Human Rights are a western concept\". He was partly right. Human Rights indeed is a foreign concept to the Indian society. Most people won\\'t agree with what Human Rights say.', \"Ever since the new changes came to Kashmir the place is definitely not democratic and protected by human rights. \\n\\n* No transparency\\n\\n* Authoritarianism/No power to people\\n\\n* Human rights violations\\n\\n* Government openly lying\\n\\n* IT Cell working at full capacity to spread anti-muslim(or anyone who oppose RSS/BJP) hatred/rumors\\n\\n* Use of pellet guns\\n\\n* Rape (I don't have proof, but i know it's been happening, although this can be omitted from the list on the basis of No proof)\\n\\n* murder (This one, you decide)\\n\\nBut it's something else that made me write all this, this : [How Kashmiri Children Are Being ‘Picked Up’ in Night Raids by Security Forces Across Kashmir](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/kashmir-situation-night-raids-children-article-370-srinagar-pulwama)\\n\\nA parent won't have any difficulty to understand this : if your child's life are at stake then 9/10 parents won't care about law/rules/regulation/government atall, it's not even in your control to think about law it's just your body's reaction.\\n\\n**Now here is the thing :** As we and the whole world knows pakistan's primary defense/offence is terrorism, it's part of who they are (it's indoctrinated through the web of madrasahs, just read about hafiz saeed).\\n\\nAll they have to do is transport guns and weapons to kashmir, **Before** this whole mess, the people of kashmir wouldn't accept any such weapon at large.

Additionally the cow is a herbivore while the tiger is a carnivore. ~~Most~~ Many Indians are vegetarians which can be equated to being herbivorous. So I think the cow would better represent our country.\\n\\nWhat do you guys think?\", \"So I am not the kind of person who believes in conspiracy theories, but the turn of events over this year has me broadly convinced that the Indian MSM is working against our interests and there is a larger cabal with sufficient economic resources and a clear agenda driving it. \\n\\nI think it all started with the Modi govt. banning NGOs. So, I was one of those who thought that this was a retrograde move. A lot of NGO's do good - I know for a fact that a lot of implicit missionary activities goes on behind the scenes, but I have no problem if people convert to christianity so that they can make bread. The christian missionaries might have ulterior motives - but its still fine with me. The poor of this country are better of with bread and god, than neither. \\n\\nI think all this media manipulation started of post this act of hte Modi govt.. When NGO's were pumping money into India, there was a relatively easy channel to 'wake up' our population to the service of Jesus. But the ban on NGO's put water to by and large this act which had been going unhindered for a couple of decades now. The media manipulation that we are seeing now, is partly a response to this act of the Modi govt. and partly a newer and more effective strategy to bring Jesus into our lives. It is this more effective strategy which has rankled me most.\\n\\nEven though Indians might see themselves a secular country, the world - and by and large the western world, does not. For the west India is broadly Hindu - the failings of India are by and large the failings of Hinduism. The media strategy is amazingly effective because it does not need to direct Hindusim - what it does instead is direct India itself and it is left to the imagination of the audience to make that connect with Hindusim. This, as most marketing gurus will tell you, is one of the most effective marketing ploys. Do not sell water to the thirsty, but glorify the beauty of your wells and let people make that connect in their minds. \\n\\nI think it is broadly known that a lot of agencies which funds NGO's in India also have significant interests in the media. Add to that delipidated law and order infrastructure in the country and lot of medieval social/cultural mores still present in parts of the society makes India the perfect hot spot for these kind of shenanigans. A population which is acutely aware of their failings is the perfect ground for the harvesting of souls - the societies which come from Jesus do not have any such social ills and this connect is left for the audience to make for themselves.\\n\\nThe biggest success of this strategy was obviously the delhi rape incident and the documentary behind it. However, I would like to give credit to the home minister Rajnath singh, who acted like a rank amateur here and walked into the trap by banning it. The documentary was shoddily made and it would have died a natural death had it not been for the home minister who is probably the weakest link in the modi govt. However, credit should also be given to NDTV who went on a rampage and raped India in broad daylight. Barkha dutt defending India was either born out of her realisation that her game is being outed and so that she can salvage whatever little credibility is left.\\n\\nThe thing is that this game is not over yet and everyday I am reading news reports which try to play up this angle. There was something on bachelors not getting rents or maybe it was muslims. Then there was the thing about a muslim guy being denied jobs.

Some are going through menopause while still in their twenties. It is impossible for women to give birth after menopause. This means women are fertile for a lesser period. This also means difficulty in having kids and a much shorter sex life, over before it even begins sometimes. Post-menopause the quality of sex goes down and mood swings are common. Women also age rapidly after hitting menopause. If you marry a thirty year old woman, she may already have had her menopause for all you know.\\n\\nSee\\n\\nhttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-01/india/38188866_1_early-menopause-many-urban-women-menstrual-cycle\\n\\nThis post will get a lot of rants from women understandably. I want to know from men in India, whether they would still consider marrying, in these circumstances.\\n\", '', \"I returned back from a trip and tried to catch up with the latest news.
