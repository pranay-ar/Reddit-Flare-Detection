* Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub\\n * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze\\n * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell\\n * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell\\n* Don't\\n * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your

^that‚Äôs ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you‚Äôve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.\\n\\n^It‚Äôs ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.\\n\\n1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don‚Äôt have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it‚Äôs absolutely essential. Don‚Äôt take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\\n\\n2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people ‚Äî in your home, or in a car, because you‚Äôre on your way to see a doctor (and only after you‚Äôve called first) ‚Äî wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\\n\\n3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven‚Äôt just washed them.\\n\\n4. **DISINFECTING**: Don‚Äôt share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\\n\\n5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you‚Äôre touching anything that might carry the patient‚Äôs bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\\n\\n#####Share your Idle CPU/GPU Power towards find solutions for Covid-19\\n\\n&gt;Do you have a CPU/GPU sitting at home, not doing anything?

Please help.', 'So, [SlicePay](https://sliceit.com) the startup which in its own words would \"redesign your financial experience\" did that for me, in the worst way possible. I am not here to rant and rave but to show the true face of the corporate greed which clearly indicates that there\\'s something wrong with all of this.   \\n\\n\\nTo begin with, I am an entrepreneur and freelancer, having a line of credit that too with a limit of just 10,000 INR is not all that bad. However, when COVID-19 struck, I lost my clients and the due receivables from my prior clients were also stuck up. Quite reasonably, I would need to worry about my survival in a city like Mumbai and thus had whatever little I saved up in my accounts cashed due to obvious fear of not being able to pay for basic commodities. However, Slicepay through its clever legal loopholes and fuelled by its corporate hunger would not consider even a moratorium. Constant threats and random people claiming to be \"recovery agents\" have called and texted me. Even after a telephonic call with their actual staff who said I can pay it later with higher interest which I agreed to, even after that I have been completely harassed on a regular basis. \\n\\nSo what is the takeaway? Well, for starters if you were thinking about this service think again. I am not an isolated example, thankfully I am a law student and caught their BS when they called my friend who also defaulted for the same reasons and said that they\\'re in police station and are filing FIR. If they can do this during a global pandemic, god forbid they become a major player in India.']}\n"
