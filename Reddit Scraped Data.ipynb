infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don‚Äôt have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it‚Äôs absolutely essential. Don‚Äôt take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\\n\\n2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people ‚Äî in your home, or in a car, because you‚Äôre on your way to see a doctor (and only after you‚Äôve called first) ‚Äî wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\\n\\n3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven‚Äôt just washed them.\\n\\n4. **DISINFECTING**: Don‚Äôt share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\\n\\n5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you‚Äôre touching anything that might carry the patient‚Äôs bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\\n\\n#####Share your Idle CPU/GPU Power towards find solutions for Covid-19\\n\\n&gt;Do you have a CPU/GPU sitting at home, not doing anything?

We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India. \\xa0This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.\\n\\nWe devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore‚Äôs TraceTogether, MIT‚Äôs Private Kit : Safe Path‚Äôs Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing. \\xa0To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court‚Äôs developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It\\'s possible if we try!\\n\\n## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off\\n\\nThe world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.\\n\\nHowever, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.\\n\\nRecognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.\\n\\n## Overview of the working paper\\n\\nThis [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.\\n\\nFollowing this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person‚Äôs autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore‚Äôs TraceTogether, MIT‚Äôs Private Kit : Safe Path‚Äôs Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.\\n\\nFinally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, ‚Äú.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.‚Äù\\n\\n## We have three primary objectives from this working paper\\n\\n*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.\\n\\n*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.\\n\\n*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don\\'t have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).\\n\\n## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?\\n\\nWe will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.\\n\\nThis working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.\\n\\n## Links to our Covid related work\\n\\n1.

At 100 cases, we started isolation. At 500 cases, we did a lockdown for 21 days [6 minutes in speech]\\n- It\\'s unfair to compare with other countries. However, if we compare, India is at a relatively good standing (by around _25 to 30 times_). [8 minutes in speech]. The lockdown and social distancing was expensive but worth it. Still, _the rate of spread is alarming_ [10 minutes in speech].\\n- Citizens, state governments, bodies have suggested and some have _already_ implemented an extension to lockdown. **Lockdown has been extended till 3rd May 2020** (under the _same circumstances and conditions_). [12 minutes in speech].\\n- We have to avoid the spread of COVID in regions. Death due to this must be even more worrisome. _We must stay vigilant with current and emerging hotspots_. New hotspots will bring problems. \\n    - **Stronger constraints and implementation of lockdown till 20th April 2020**. Essential services and operations can resume for areas of lower risks (under conditions for going out). _If any traces of COVID, the lockdown shall be reimposed_. [16 minutes in speech].\\n- _A guideline shall be released by tomorrow_ (_15th April 2020_). Major steps are taken to _help the poor and needy_. The government has helped them through various funds, specially farmers. There are efforts being made for helping farmers, supply chain is being improved [18 minutes in speech]\\n- We\\'ve already organized over 1L hospital beds and 600+ COVID hospitals. Scientists are encouraged to help in these times of crisis [20 minutes in speech].\\n\\n### Help needed in 7 areas \\nThe public is encouraged to focus on the following areas [start 22 minutes in speech]:\\n\\n1. _Extra care of the elderly_ in the house\\n2. **Obey lockdown**. Use **homemade** masks.\\n3. Improve immunity.\\n4. Download \"Aarogya Setu\" [mobile app](https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/) and encourage others to download it.\\n5. Help the poor and needy\\n6. Don\\'t terminate employment of workers under you\\n7. Respect the front line workers (police, healthcare professionals, etc.)\\n\\n**Please follow the above till 3 May 2020** [till 24 minutes in speech].\\n\\n\\n## Key points observed:\\n- PM Narendra Modi were wearing a mask which was a muffler (*Not an N95 respirator or a surgical mask*) in the beginning of the address.\\n- _Started at 10 AM_ and went on _till 10:25 AM_ on 14th April 2020.', \"Hi folks, I really appreciate the warm response from all of you on my previous post. I am currently in Bangalore and my mom's treatment is undergoing in BMS hospital. The doctor prescribed two tests to know level of infection but due to lockdown next day only, it couldn't be done. Now that hospital's lab person is saying I need to wait till end of the second phase of lockdown. The particular tests(HBV DNA QUANT, SAFP and other tests) are cheaper in this hospital due to tie up with NGO. If I get these done in other hospital, I need to spend three to four times more money. With no job currently and already bad financial condition, it's really a nightmare for me. I called government hospitals also but they are not doing any test due to COVID. It's not safe to take her to crowded hospital as she has diabetes also. Please tell me what should I do in this situation. The doctor told us to get the test urgently as situation is too critical. I have tweeted to pmo for this but I think it won't reach him as he must be getting  lots of tweets. If you stay in Bangalore and know where I can get these tests in less cost, kindly let me know.

Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF‚Äôs Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\nOn April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called, \\xa0‚Äú[***Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view)‚Äù. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *Aarogya Setu*.\\n\\nIFF‚Äôs working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government‚Äôs *Trace Together* application, MIT‚Äôs *Private Kit: Safe Paths* initiative, and *Aarogya Setu*.\\n\\n**What is Contact Tracing?**\\n\\nAccording to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.\\n\\nContact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).   \\n\\n\\nAs a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user‚Äôs device comes in contact with another user‚Äôs device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  \\n\\n\\n**What‚Äôs the Risk?**   \\n\\n\\nWith the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief, \\xa0most apps which are purported as ‚Äòcontact tracing‚Äô technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.\\n\\nA lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between ‚Äúsnake oil‚Äù and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.\\n\\nSuch systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.\\n\\nIt may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.\\n\\n**How to prevent these risks?**\\n\\nSuch systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:\\n\\n1. The usage of these applications should be voluntary\\n2. All data should always be stored locally on people‚Äôs devices\\n3. This data must be encrypted\\n4. No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server\\n5. Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.\\n6. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  \\n\\n\\nTherefore, we need to adhere to two principles:\\n\\n1. Strict limits \\xa0(in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and\\n2. Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way\\n\\n**Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zw655ssbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b\\n\\nConsider the following aspects.\\n\\n**Is this for disease control or for other purposes?**\\n\\nIn other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.\\n\\nIn India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *Aarogya Setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.\\n\\nTo protect people‚Äôs right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***Aarogya Setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.\\n\\n**Minimisation? What Minimisation?**\\n\\n1. Singapore monitors people‚Äôs interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and **then there‚Äôs India which uses both**.\\n2. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India‚Äôs Aarogya Setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zy6tp8hvbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ea4b8aca61a8e38ec771f8ad785c5211b2bf17\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnrv4i6wbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23f8c169d0699880af385910b6ee8b4799d23955\\n\\n**No Transparency leads to discretion**\\n\\nThe only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does *Aarogya Setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.\\n\\nSimilarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app‚Äôs Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.\\n\\n**No Accountability and No Auditability**\\n\\nThe Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government‚Äôs processes are compliant with the right to privacy.\\n\\nSecond, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people‚Äôs personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.\\n\\n**Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit**\\n\\nFinally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *Aarogya Setu* project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.\\n\\nFinally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people‚Äôs informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people‚Äôs informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.\\n\\n**Links to IFF‚Äôs COVID-19 Related Work**\\n\\n1.

To my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask, I was stopped by a cop in civillian clothing and was asked what I was doing outside, to which I stated my reason and then was asked why I was not wearing a mask and told him the truth. I was then struck by the cop with a swat bat thingy thrice at that point, I decided to floor my bike and dipped out of there at fool speed. \\n\\nI can't help but rationlize why I was struck. My friend says that I was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. He then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (My friend btw, is Indian and lives in a Middle Eastern country). Was it right for the cop to strike me? I can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe I should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened.

I didn't mention this but, I am sort of new to India, I came here like last year to complete my UG, so I didn't take into account that the Indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where I was raised (i.e, Middle East). I admit that I was in the wrong for not wearing a mask, however, I don't think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering I showed him proof of reason as to why I was outside in the first place. \\n\\nNeither do I think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as I think he would've conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first.

Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he\\xa0discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment\\xa0and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.\\n\\n>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high\\xa0and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low,\\xa0and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.\\n\\n>A\\xa0second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast\\xa0pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.\\n\\nDoes this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .\\n\\nLow inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .\\n\\nDuring Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it \\n\\n\\nThe reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures\\n\\n\\n>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using\\xa0monetary policy. To do so, the\\xa0Federal Reserve\\xa0(the U.S.\\xa0central bank)\\xa0relies\\xa0on the relationship between\\xa0inflation and interest rates. If\\xa0interest rates\\xa0are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging\\xa0animal spirits\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/is-low-inflation-the-culprit-for-indias-economic-woes/articleshow/71190710.cms\", '', 'Hi.

Over 1,000 people were injured.\\n\\nSome facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:\\n\\n1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.\\n2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.\\n3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.\\n4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.\\n5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.\\n6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings\\n7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.\\n8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi ‚Äì the Sikh festival.\\n9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.\\n10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.\\n11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.\\n12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.\\n13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.\\n14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.\\n15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.\\n16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations\\n17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.\\n18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920‚Äì22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.\\n19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.\\n20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.\\n21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.\\n22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.\\n23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British\\n24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been \"confronted by a  revolutionary army\", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  \"Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves\\n25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  \"unutterably monstrous\", while Asquith called it \"one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history\".\\n26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  \"The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything‚Ä¶ When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.\"\\n27. After Churchill\\'s speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.\\n28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar‚Äôs Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.\\n29. Colonel Michael O\\'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.\\n30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.\\n31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.\\n\\n# Shaheed Uddham Singh\\n\\n1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 ‚Äì 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O\\'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940\\n2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment \\n3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O\\'Dyer.\\n4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940\\n5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:\\n\\n>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?\\n\\nSingh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).\\n\\n# Following his conviction, he made a speech\\n\\nwhich the judge directed should not be released to the press.\\\\[9\\\\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material\\n\\nHe started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:\\n\\n>\"I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .\"  \\n>  \\n>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  \\n>  \\n>\"I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.‚Äô Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‚ÄòWe are suffering from the British Empire.‚Äô Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‚ÄòI am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  \\n>  \\n>\"I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.‚Äô  \\n>  \\n>\"I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.‚Äô \"Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.‚Äô  \\n>  \\n>\"Your conduct, your conduct ‚Äì I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.‚Äô  \\n>  \\n>\"You people are suffering ‚Äì workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying ‚Äì British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.\"  \\n>  \\n>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  \\n>  \\n>\"You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  \\n>  \\n>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  \\n>  \\n>\\'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!\"  \\n>  \\n>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor‚Äôs table.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHis remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.\\n\\n# Picture thread: [https://imgur.com/a/L5kbEBc](https://imgur.com/a/L5kbEBc)\\n\\nSources & Material you should read:\\n\\n1.
