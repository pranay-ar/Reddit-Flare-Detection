Fuck all Religion,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,4198,Politics,17867,f9outu,1582726249.0,pking3,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 Â°C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Se[r]ious replies only.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38heyu/help_ideas_needed_hll_poisoned_my_village_with/,257,[R]eddiquette,8055,38heyu,1433426057.0,UnileverCancerFactor,"I don't want to leave this be, and need some help on which NGO's might be interested in fighting this case.

**Background Reading**

* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

Further studies in case you are interested.

[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 

[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 Âµg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 Âµg/kg and 8.3 Âµg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 

Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.

edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.

To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.

edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.

I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.

Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM.",2015-06-04 19:24:17

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a âdaredevil selfieâ when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngstersâ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Only 13 out of 1000 marriages result in a divorce in India. 
It could be due to arranged marriages, society pressure and the stigma attached to it. Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence. 

Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages. Failed marriage is not the same as a divorce. Just the absence of divorce doesnât mean all is well.",2019-04-17 22:00:12

I turn on Indian news channels and everyone says ""we always wanted peace, Pakistan doesn't want peace"". 
The media is clearly not truthful on either sides and have been manipulating citizens of both countries for years. 
I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.
We all watch cricket together and recently when India and Pakistan were versing each other we were all having a great time.
Politics and media has ruined us.

Mr. Frank Anthony who has addressed you is a Christian. There are also Sikhs and Parsis here. The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics. This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims herself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose, and worship in any way we please. So far as politics is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other.
