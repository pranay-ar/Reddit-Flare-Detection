What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,AskIndia,8,918ek7,1532391253.0,kasam_se,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

He has also offered alternative conceptions relating to cosmopolitanism and critical traditionalism. In addition to the above, Nandy has offered an original historical profile of India's commercial cinema as well as critiques of state and violence.

>""During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy, a prominent Indian intellectual, began a series of interviews with R.S.S. members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,AskIndia,8,bwmz0o,1559671479.0,chuttadrockstar,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

To Redditors of Kolkata,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,AskIndia,1,bpgagr,1558060692.0,arkoprovo1996,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

In case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",2019-05-17 08:08:12
Need help with depression and anger.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,3,AskIndia,6,7yz12m,1519186110.0,officialshebu,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",2018-02-21 09:38:30
"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,AskIndia,48,4gbzmf,1461592127.0,hganjoo,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

He was telling me that almost everyone including students & faculty is pissed off with the recent appointment of Mr. Gajendra as director. 

People there at large feel the man is not at all qualified for the job and students are planning for a massive protest against the high-handed appointment. There was no prior consultation was faculty member there whatsoever.

Now I did some digging and found out there seems to be pattern amongst all of the recent appointments.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.

An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/,1,AskIndia,1,28fy7b,1403105851.0,nerds_revenge,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",2014-06-18 21:07:31

Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

[Serious Post] Bye,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f161mw/serious_post_bye/,124,AskIndia,376,f161mw,1581266387.0,Snoopyrun,"It's about time for me. I don't see the relevance of trying to go through the drudgery again and again. I beg for some patience on your part to go through this post.

At 30 years of age with no set path for a career, I am utterly useless. I can't even provide for myself, let alone take care of others.

I am a 30-year-old, so-called general category lower-class family, man. Haha, how pathetic, isn't it.

&#x200B;

I was a good student till Xth, and then the slow downhill started in my scores. Struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70% with just pass 50% in mathematics.

&#x200B;

Then, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.

&#x200B;

Did [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.

&#x200B;

No jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\ for it.  This was 6 years back.

Why?

Because there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.

Trained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.

GOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.

After a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.

Then, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.

Being absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.

I remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.

HEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.

Below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.

NOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -

what I am doing about it?

What I am doing to learn new skills?

What am I doing to even get into another job?

The answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?

because I am listless.

I lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.

I lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.

I lack the mathematical skills.

Now would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.

But now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.

&#x200B;

Since these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.

Sometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.

You might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.

My family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.

My lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.

Sometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.

What a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.

But there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.

All doors are shut for me now.

Today while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.

At least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.

Thus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.

I have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.

Now, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post. You have empathy and I pray for it to grow in your heart.

Bye.",2020-02-09 22:09:47

-------------

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

I just put my fingerprint in, held my phone next to the machine and it read the card. All I had to do was insert the pin and I was done. Waiter didn't react much, probably because he was tired. 

2: I used it at a gelato shop. Same POS machine. The cashier said that they don't support mobile payments (lol). I asked them to hand the machine to me, held my phone next to it and boop. It worked. He was super impressed and had this big grin after the transaction.

Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 – 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,” the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.”

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam’s Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder. MOM is an effective way to treat patients with limited resources available.

###### Herbal Sanitizers

Washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of COVID-19. All countries are stressing the importance of washing hands to keep ourselves safe from infection. The cost and demand for personal hygiene products have shot up around the country.

Students from IIT-Roorkee have prepared herbal sanitizers to promote personal hygiene. The sanitizers meet the regulations of [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and the US government health research institute (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)).

###### Disinfectant Tunnel

A water treatment company in Tirupur, Tamilnadu has designed a disinfectant tunnel that can disinfect people as we walk through it. This portable tunnel is about 16-feet, made of stainless steel and fitted into a mild steel frame.

###### Arogya Setu and Corona Kavach App

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have collaborated to develop a COVID-19 exposure risk tracking applications. The beta version of these Apps will be of use to track if the user has any exposure to coronavirus patients. These Apps will track the user’s location and alert them if they come across a person who was tested positive for the virus.

##### Innovation Contests and Funding Events

Several government agencies and private sector companies have come forward to encourage and support innovations and designs developed to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

###### COVID-19 Solution Challenge

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this challenge to involve active community participation around the country. The challenge is accepting solutions to help fight COVID-19. The best solutions that could be adopted in real life will be rewarded. The contest will give away prizes totaling to 1,75,000 INR.

The last date to [participate](https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/) is 16 April 2020.

###### United Against COVID-19-Innovation Challenge

The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) with Startup India has announced an open call for all companies, startups, and innovators to offer solutions that can bridge the gap between the demand and supply of medical requirements used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The contest encourages innovators to work on med-tech, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to come up with ideas, prototypes, and designs to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for [entries](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=5e79126ee4b055bfaea9ef66) is 15 April 2020.

###### Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)

National Innovation Foundation – India (NIF), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology – India has [announced](http://nif.org.in/challenge-covid-19-competition) a competition to find solutions to the most pressing problems in the COVID-19 scenario.

The C3 encourages innovations to reduce virus transmission, improve sanitizing facilities and enhance door delivery options for the elderly. Currently, the contest is accepting entries on a rolling application basis.

###### Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH)

The Indian Ministry of Science and Technology has formed the [CAWACH](https://isba.in/cawach/) to identify and support innovations of startups working on the novel, safe and affordable respiratory devices, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and any other innovation to control and treat the spread of COVID-19. The Centre is equipped with funds amounting to 56 Crore and plans to identify 50 such innovations and take them to the next level.

Many State Governments have also come up with challenges motivating students, startups, innovators around the country to come up with innovative solutions to face this health crisis. The optimistic and encouraging environment is an ideal platform for budding innovators.

Today marks our 71st Republic day. It's been an [annual tradition of sorts](https://internetfreedom.in/a-republic-day-letter-from-iff/) at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.

## India stands on the edge of a technological precipice

Over a year, IFF's work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways  our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.

To  cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression,  privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and  I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will  become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to  say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever before.

We  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones,  facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up  with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government  institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To  accelerate timelines, one of IFF's missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.

Financial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic  legitimacy, discipline and transparency (*transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020*).  We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.

We  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors.  Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are  thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  products.

Today, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to ""*secure*""   the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble.  All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr.  B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote  and adopted, “*I say that this  Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that  this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty,* ***from the people***. ***That it has***.”

We are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.

If you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to[ become a IFF Member](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) today.

Chandrayaan Moon Landing,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0ffgv/chandrayaan_moon_landing/,1402,AskIndia,501,d0ffgv,1567798373.0,freddledgruntbugly,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

A place to discuss scientific and engineering research for and by Indians? [Science & Technology],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5jscfe/a_place_to_discuss_scientific_and_engineering/,3,AskIndia,5,5jscfe,1482462289.0,Glorious_Comrade,"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

I would like to hear suggestions from randian researchers and non-sci/tech folk alike on this. ",2016-12-23 08:34:49

India needs to invest more in education and health care or else the future of India is doomed.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e6ekhy/india_needs_to_invest_more_in_education_and/,53,AskIndia,192,e6ekhy,1575564775.0,thruaway593,"Why doesn't the govt invest more in education? 

Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak. 

However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable , How will india progress?

Investing in education(and healthcare) is one of the best ways to raise the human capital(skills and expertise of the population).

Currently, india ranks 115 in human capital index. Having high human capital is crucial to economic development, increasing productivity, making progress in science and technology and innovation.

According to a report from world bank,[source](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00811/WEB/OTHER/9C8ACC61.HTM?OpenDocument). More than half the children in india are malnourished, 30% of newborns are underweight and 60% of women are anemic. Malnutrition costs india atleast about $10 billion or about Rs. 700 billion(Rs 70,000 crore) in terms of lost productivity , illness and deaths, which is about 23 times the cost of statue of unity.

If india doesn't invest more in education and health care, reforming education and health care system, improving the quality and infrastructure of govt schools and hospitals too, then we will hundreds of millions of unskilled and unproductive people in the future, which would be a disaster to development and progress.",2019-12-05 22:22:55

Is the Dream of Kalam dead?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ei5wg9/is_the_dream_of_kalam_dead/,16,AskIndia,78,ei5wg9,1577842154.0,SOCH-staymoderate,"2020 is finally on the doorstep. For most Indians who grew up in the last two decades, this was a year we were awaiting for, with hopes. Well, it was even more popular than scary-end-of-the-world predictions of 2012 among others! Well, for once hope won over fear!

Now that 2020 is on us, are we the India 2020 that was popularised by Dr. Abdul Kalam? 

That dream is officially 24 years old. Kalam and his team at TIFAC prepared a vision document for the country in 1996, a decade after TIFAC itself was born, incubated under the Dept. of Science & Technology. Kalam took as much pride in the document as in his successes with ISRO and DRDO.
TIFAC laid down a roadmap for sixteen sectors the country should focus on, with numerous sub-areas of technology assessed as the means to acheive it. TIFAC certainly inspired many govt. funded programmes and missions, including TIFAC-CORE which gave a major push for research infrastructure and Industry-academia interaction.

But will 2020 be the year that Kalam and others dreamt of? Most probably not, we are most likely just halfway in that journey. But on the optimistic side, haven't we grown in all terms in the last 24 years?

But it doesn't stop here, and we needn't dwell in regret. In 2015, TIFAC came up with a renewed mission Technology Vision 2035, a sort of version 2.0, in tune with the changes within India and around the world- a fresh technological roadmap for the country's progress. It's a document prepared with so much love, and all lovers of sci-tech should look into it. As the document says: 
""... while TV 2020 spoke to an aspiration of a developed India in 2020, TV 2035 speaks to the realisation of a developed India in 2035""

https://tifac.org.in/index.php/activities/technology-vision-2035

So lovers of science and the country, let's keep dreaming- this time more vividly and work more vigorously to give our tiny bit to it! :)

Happy new year ! let the dreams keep going!",2020-01-01 06:59:14

The work here is repetitive, with an outdated technology stack and that's why I have been planning to leave it. But I am confused whether to switch the job or do post graduation?

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

Please give me some advise about what I should do now. Also please share if anything else comes to your mind that can work for me.",2020-02-16 04:25:29

I recently got placed in two MNC's first is 'hexaware technologies' and second is 'infosys'.
I have gap in my education does it matter when they perform background verification and terminate me afterwards?
 
My story is :- passed ssc in 2012 and 11th in 2013 , HSC in 2014 
But i got only 60% marks so i wasn't getting any engineering colleges so i decided to go for direct second year diploma for year 2015 and i failed in it. So i had to make exit from diploma and tried for HSC improvement for year 2016 . Got 62 and choose ""Computer science"" Btech . I'm expecting to get graduated by 2020. Now i have 2 jobs in my hand . Both are MNCs. There was no gap criteria mentioned for hexaware but i am not sure about infosys. But if it had been i wouldn't have had been selected. ( I mentioned 1 year of gap while giving first round of infosys, i got that round cleared too ) 

 Backround check usually happens with third party companies.   And as my portfolio looks life this
2012 SSC
2016 HSC 
2020 Btech 
We can see there is timeframe of 4 years between my 10th and 12th, but that is not even gap as first i gave HSC in 2014 , for 2015 i was pursuing diploma ( which i left )  and 2016 again got through HSC .

Does that show any discrepancy in my educational journey? 
Or background verification team just checks for your graduation marks ? Or will they ask me for more information before terminating me? If that happens :(
Please tell me

I passed 12th in 2018, and gave jee for the 1st time. Faired miserably and repeated a year and again gave it in 2019. Again didn't study properly and faired badly. Got into an okay okay private college called Heritage Institute of Technology in Kolkata. I'm studying ECE(Electronics and communication engineering) out there.

I've always wanted to study Computer science. With that in mind, I started trying to study discrete math from online resources. However, after finding the road too steep, I gave up. I thought, it'll be better to get a CS degree.

With that in mind, I decided to write Jee again.

In a private college, cracking GATE is my best option to go to a better place, but I doubt if I'll be capable enough to crack it and get into a better college. So I thought, better to write Jee again and try and get some private college with better placement opportunity so that I won't always be in uncertainty over my future.

But now, I don't know if this is the best decision. I don't know what to do. Whether to give up with Jee or continue. I sometimes feel embarrassed to give the exam again. I hate myself, my choices. I don't really know what I want from life. It's like I'm just doing things, not going anywhere - life has no direction.

Raised by Mom who worked at a private school.  

I opted for science after the board exams. Realized I won't even pass, had to fight with family members to change it to Commerce and I passed with 57% marks. 

Came to Mumbai to study CA, Estimated around 2.5 lakhs as fees & Expenses.   Couldn't afford that.  I  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead. 

Learned computer engineering (hardware networking) for one year  and got a job at a MNC, worked in that field for 6 years. I was just 17 when Joining this Job & a Didn't complete my Graduation. 

Around 5th year in my job I realized I had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems. 


I started learning more and more about it, and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money.  But to really make something worthwhile I had to dedicate more time.  

I used to live in Virar and traveling to Andheri (Mumbai) every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn't want to work anymore.  

So in around 2013 I left my job and decided to move full time into Internet marketing. 
My wife, her parents and my Mom all thought I have gone mad and pretty stupid. And honestly That's pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age. 

For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies. The most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training. The company paid $35 per lead and I made more than $4K per month (around 2L in INR) with it.  

This boosted my confidence and I invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing. 

I used to post my screenshots on Facebook, In 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet.   He looked confident and we meet at a Google conference later that Week.  

We discussed what we both has been doing. He had lots of contacts at emerging companies and I had the skills, strategies , and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns.   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together. 

We built a digital agency, the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue. We quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company. 

In next 3 years We worked with more than a dozen listed companies, 3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves.  

At materialistic levels, just last year he bought a very expensive car (80 lakhs), travelled to over 30 countries and I bought  a expensive home (3BHK powai - 2.5 cr).  

We are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to. 

At multiple times in my career I had to fight with my own people, go against the wind to make my way.  

Point of all this is, you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public.  There is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but can't do shit about it. Either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons. 

For You, I strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill - mostly in a area you enjoy doing , and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income. 
Once you are confident enough and have some numbers (revenue) to back it up, take a leap of faith and see where it takes.   


Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.   

I agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else.  Just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that. 

Parents ko bus paise chaiye. As long as they see you are making good enough,  they will be fine. Sooner or later.   My father in-law loves to flaunt when I share my photos with a BMW and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive.

Will the conflict between India and Pakistan ever come to an end?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eh3s70/will_the_conflict_between_india_and_pakistan_ever/,9,AskIndia,0,eh3s70,1577637929.0,thruaway593,"Will peace ever prevail between these two countries?

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

I'd like to see humanity become a Type 1 civilisation and this means contribution from this one-fifth of humanity is also important.",2019-12-29 22:15:29

I have a couple of questions. 

1. How did you find the syllabus different from regular run of the mill engineering college.
1. How would you rate the seriousness and dedication of fellow students. 
1. The website tells me that most students do an internship at one of the ISRO facilities. Did you get such an opportunity ? How was your experience ? Did you contribute to an actual projects (even if in minuscule way)
1. And finally what's the employment situation like. Do a lot of people get absorbed into ISRO ? Do a lot of people like that or do you see a lot of ""brain drain"" ?

Education & Science ft. BJP [on the eve of Pariksha Pe Charcha by Narendra Modi],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ercuql/education_science_ft_bjp_on_the_eve_of_pariksha/,1,AskIndia,8,ercuql,1579553735.0,The_andh_bhakth,"https://preview.redd.it/f7scwd5qfxb41.jpg?width=1549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de8994dc03fea1d02c1012fe69a1c27fa18ecd59

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

&#x200B;

Here's a compilation of few:  


 1. **India’s Education Budget Cannot Fund Proposed New Education Policy** \[ [https://www.indiaspend.com/indias-education-budget-cannot-fund-proposed-new-education-policy/](https://www.indiaspend.com/indias-education-budget-cannot-fund-proposed-new-education-policy/) \]

since 2015, government spending on school education has actually decreased after correcting for inflation, according to an analysis of state and central education finances over the years.

[https://www.newsclick.in/4-years-systematic-destruction-education-under-modi-regime](https://www.newsclick.in/4-years-systematic-destruction-education-under-modi-regime) 

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education. It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

I'm in final year(about to give 7th sem exams) doing B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college.

My problem is I don't know where to put my time into.

From the people I have talked to, I know Data Structures, Algorithms and problem solving is a **must** for big companies and if I want to actually succeed in this industry but most of the job description of startups are like some knowledge of popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Data  Science, Machine Learning and that too with a requirement of 1 or 2+ years.

I'm overwhelmed by everything! Though I'm already placed in an MNC with <4lpa package through campus placement, I want to get a better paying job as a software developer/engineer.

I have done some *not so fascinating* projects in Python and JavaScript but Idk if I should continue or just say fuck it to all the languages/frameworks etc and just invest my time into HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces etc but unfortunately a lot of good companies which ask for DSA problems don't even consider tier 3 grads so learning some stack then becomes kinda important to me. I don't know.

But, as of now, I'm looking for various options and I'm wondering whether you guys can help. So, here's my background/interests to help you help me:

1) Education: BE in CS branch. Abysmal Percentage/GPA.

2) 2 years of experience in Software field, of which I have no interest to continue. Neither am I interested in Data Science/AI or whatever other crappy buzzword that often gets thrown around.

3) I'm interested in Sociology/History/Literature/Politics etc. Can spend whole day in front of a book. Can spend time without getting bored watching, reading about these topics.

4) I'm a bit shy and introverted, but I'm confident of overcoming those.

5) No pressure to earn more money. Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month.

6) Ready to pursue any course in any other field (Banking etc)

Almost all of us have lived through the past decade. Some of you have even seen another momentous shift, ushering in the new millennium; while others have seen more of these events passing by.

The last ten years have redefined the way we live, and we are now even closer to each other. Things that were science fiction to a kid in the 1990s is a reality. Yet, we are using technology not to express ourselves but divide who we are collectively as humans. Algorithms are segmenting and compartmentalizing us on the basis of not only our ethnicity, but also our choices, our preferences and our actions. We are using all of the benefits of our interconnected ways in the worst ways possible; using it to gang up, humiliate and shame those that don't agree to our thoughts. We are still waging wars, and selling ourselves to be slaves for things that are pointless in the grand scheme of things.

However, today; you can stop that. You, yes you. You have the power to change, to redefine, to come together and fight all of the differences whose seeds are sown across our collective psyche. It is you who has the power to change your own life, and the power to change the lives of others around you. You may think you are an insignificant part amongst billions of people, but you're not. Today is the day you have the capability to lead by example, to create a harmonious future for the generation that comes after us, and most importantly, for yourself.

It is normal to fear, because I am afraid, more of myself and of failing others, but I am more afraid of failing to provide a better life for the next generation. But, it has to have a start somewhere, so why not today? I don't ask you of anything, but to do what your conscience thinks is right.

Thank you for reading.

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Are you tired of simplistic lock and key analogies which pervade most legal and policy discourse surrounding encryption? The last year has seen encryption technologies become a subject of intense discussion in courts and within the government. In India and several other countries, there are demands to weaken encryption through backdoors and key escrow systems to facilitate easier access to information for law enforcement agencies. At the same time, encryption is also one of the few tools available to individuals to protect themselves from surveillance by Big Brother and Big Tech. 

To bring greater clarity and technical rigour to the public discourse surrounding encryption, Internet Freedom Foundation is hosting a lecture on **‘Encryption, Security and Privacy in the Digital Age’** by **Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran** on **Saturday, 23 November 2019** from **6:30 PM to 8:00 PM** at the **Constitution Club, New Delhi**. Dr. Prabhakaran is a Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and he specialises in cryptography. Through this public lecture, Dr. Prabhakaran will explain the technical aspects of encryption in a comprehensible but nuanced manner and discuss the importance of cybersecurity and online privacy in light of contemporary developments.

We would be delighted if you could join us for the public lecture and [**you can register for the event here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/encryption-pe-charcha-a-public-lecture-by-dr-manoj-prabhakaran-tickets-81279764965).

**Statutory Warning: I work with a lot of students in the final and pre-final year of engineering and all of the interview experiences I’ve gathered is from their personal experience. While making this thread, I have consulted multiple people who work for product based, service based and start-up companies to know about their work experience and pay scale. I’ve also used LinkedIn salary and Glassdoor Salary / reviews to support my words. I am willing to modify anything if you think it is wrong!**

I see a lot of threads every week asking about the job scene in India and how to get in. I will try to put everything I know in this post. 

**Companies** 

I classify companies into 3 types

1. Product Based
2. Service Based
3. Startups

# Product Based Companies

**What are they?**

These are companies that make their own products and sell software or integration or both. Most of the “apps” that you see are examples of product based companies. Generally, it is believed that a product based company is what an engineer should aim to get into because you will be working on making a product than using the product in most cases. You will be directly involved in developing or testing a product that your company made and the chances to be exposed to the best technologies is greater

**What do they need?**

Usually in a product based firm, the training is on the job. Nobody is going to hold your hand and tell you what to do. The training will be a bunch of online videos or MOOC or just documentation(s) that you are supposed to read and figure out what you have to do. Since the job profile is going to be like this, they expect someone who can code. You should have a strong hold in at least one programming language and some companies also demand good Object-Oriented Programming skills.

**Selection Process**

Most of the good companies hire from campuses of good colleges. There will be an online platform (like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) where you are given 2 to 3 questions. The first question is going to be an easy question to test if you can write code. The 2nd and 3rd question will aim to test your CS concepts mainly Algorithms. The 2nd question will be of medium difficulty and will usually have a brute force way to solve and an optimized way. Coding a brute force method will get you half the marks as the complex test cases will timeout. The 3rd question is usually meant to test your knowledge of implementing algorithms and problem-solving skills.

Some companies (like Uber, CodeNation, etc) hire from platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) and do not really look at what college you come from. But there is always a clause of minimum 60% academic score in most of the product based companies. Some companies take this a stretch further and even have a cut-off on 10th and 12th marks.

Linkedin jobs and Glassdoor jobs are also a good place to look out, but the response from these portals are a little slow in India!

**Interview Experience**

Once you clear the coding round, you will be shortlisted for an interview. In an interview, you will be given a problem. The problem can be a CS problem (algorithms and Data Structures) or a design problem. You are given time to think about it and they don’t usually expect you to code out a solution on the computer. You can write pseudo code and you can and MUST always share your thinking.

Some interviewers are going to give you a vague question and expect you to ask questions for more clarity. No question is a stupid question. Each interview lasts anywhere between 10 minutes to 40 minutes. Nobody is expecting a complete, correct and verifiable solution, but you cannot give totally wrong solutions.

You might be additionally quizzed on your resume. They might ask you in-depth questions about every project you have written there and ask you to justify the need for that project, why you chose the technologies, what did you learn, what were the difficulties you faced, etc. Sometimes, they might even ask you some questions related to the technologies you have mentioned on your resume.

You might have anywhere between 1 to 6 such rounds after which you will have a HR round.

Some companies use these rounds to filter candidates (i.e. only a certain number of candidates go from one round to the other) and the other companies give you a score every round and decide at the end. So, stay calm and don’t be overconfident just because you’re clearing rounds.

**How do I prepare for this?**

If you’re in college, focus in class. Subjects like Algorithms and Data Structures are qualifiers to get an interview. Once inside, you will be quizzed on Algorithms (80-85%) and the remaining 15-20% you will be asked about DBMS & Computer Networks (depending on companies)

If you did not focus on these subjects, get onto platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) / [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)/ [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) and start solving. If you can solve a significant chunk of questions here, start solving questions from [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)/ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) / /r/dailyprogrammer. You can also take MIT's course on Design and Analysis of Algorithm [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/). Some of the favorite questions are about Dynamic Programming, Trees, Hashing and Graphs.

**Salary & Benefits**

You can’t put a cap on salary on a product based firm. You can get anywhere between 6LPA to 12LPA (or more) as a base salary. It depends on companies. Check GlassDoor for reviews, know what the company does and see if your interests align with the company’s interest. Have a look at their official websites, know about their products and research before you go attend an interview. 

# Service Based Companies

**What are they?**

They’re companies that use the products that are available in the market and provide a service to a client. Some service based companies have developed their own products also, but most of the money in such companies comes from providing a service to a customer. Ex : Cognizant, TCS, etc

**What do they need?**

These companies are looking for someone who can wear multiple hats. When you are interviewing (as a fresher) to a service based companies, you will likely be hired under an umbrella role of “Associate” or “Engineer”. You might get into development, testing or support. Support isn’t the kind where you have to work in a call center, but its not a primarily engineering job either. The pay is less but the role can be fun depending on how much you put into work. You will have a wide array of options to come up in your career and nobody will expect a lot from you. At least not like the product based companies! 

**Selection Process**

Call for interviews are usually through walk-in interviews or an aptitude test. You will have to search websites that carter to jobs for freshers. ([TimesJobs](https://www.timesjobs.com/), [FirstNaukri](https://www.firstnaukri.com/), etc). You should be looking for an open-for-all kind of test. TCS has their own annual hiring tests, so you will have to follow TCS to know the dates. Infosys does hiring through open-to-all aptitude tests. You can also find information on the Careers section of these companies. Some smaller companies offer walk-in interviews or are found in job fairs.

Tests like [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) also help you get interview calls. [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) tests you for basic arithmetic aptitude, English comprehension skills, logic and reasoning skills, etc. You get a score and you wait for companies to call you for interview after [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/). 

There are also “coaching” institutes that teach you basic programming and offer you a 100% job guarantee. Most of the time, these jobs are for service based companies. The coaching fees can be anywhere between 10k to 25k. 

**Do you research before you pay for any service, don’t take my word for it**

A good entry point here is reference. If you know someone working for the company, you can get a referral and get an interview. This is very much valid here and a great percentage of hiring happens through referrals also. Many service based companies leverage your attitude over your skills. Some exploit your desperation to get you in for a lower pay.

**Interview Experience**

There isn’t a standard practice for interviews in a service based company. It basically depends on your interviewer. I know people who were asked a lot of theory questions based on their field of engineering even though the company had nothing to do with that field. But I also know people who were just asked HR-round questions like “Why do you want to join this company?” and “How would you tackle X scenario?” 

So pray to your favorite God(s) and Goddess(es) before you go for an interview. Read up about interview experiences for the company on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm) and [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/interview-experiences/) to get a rough idea of the kind of questions they might ask. Don’t be nervous!

**How to prepare?**

Basic aptitude and sometimes basic coding is what these companies look for. Basic coding means you should be able to understand what for/while/if-else if-else constructs do and maybe write a code to sort an array. Refer [IndiaBix](https://indiabix.com) for aptitude and take a programming language tutorial on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). (You’re better off with [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp) or [Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java), but if you find them difficult start with [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python). But, eventually, move to [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)/[Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) any one). Aim at getting 3 or 4 stars on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)!

**Salary & Benefits**

Salary can be from the range of 3 lpa to 6lpa depending on your company and interview. There is a scope of coming up in the job, but there is also a scope of getting frustrated with the job. Your job MIGHT be something as simple as forwarding tickets or something complex like fixing code or managing a service fault. But, what will get you up in this field is your dedication to work and patience. It is easier to climb into management in a service based company than it is in a product based company. While it is easier, it isn’t necessarily faster. It’s a very slow process and will take some time. So, if you lack patience or if you are looking to do a specific field of work (like, development only), this job isn’t for you.

Its relatively relaxing and you are a fish in an ocean, so the expectation the upper management has from you isn’t very high! You’ve standard benefits like insurance, variable pay / bonus, cab facility, etc. But don’t expect to be pampered :P

# Startups

**What are they?**

These are usually very small, very new companies that are in the prototype stage. They’ve just got their service out in the market. They’re MOSTLY a product-based company. They’re new, they’re young, they’re not making a lot of money currently, but they promise something big in the future.

**What do they need?**

Young, talented people who work without a lot of hand-holding. It helps if you’ve worked on technologies that they are looking for. A lot of companies use open-source tech, so its not something you need to go to classes to be trained in. Obviously, you must be able to take a lot of responsibility and write good quality code as your mentor will not be looking at every line of your code.

You are given a lot of independence, but you have a lot of responsibility too!

**Selection process**

If a start-up is coming on-campus, then they’re going to go the product company way and kick in some [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) tests. There is no single way a start-up hires. Sometimes, you will be able to get in by just calling them up and asking for an internship or emailing the HR or contacting the HR on LinkedIn. In smaller companies, you can even get in touch with the founders via LinkedIn and ask for an opportunity.

A lot of the start-ups are on [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and that can be your starting point. I think it is right to add that not all start-ups are innovative. Some “start-ups” aren’t really centers of innovation, but are only for money making. Today, if you open a coaching class that will train students in technology, you can get away by calling it a start-up. So, do your research about the company. If it is a very new company and has very few people, that isn’t usually a great company to start off with, unless, you are really interested in working on the product they have.

You can also keep a look out of Internship Fairs. A lot of the HR teams attend such fairs to hire graduates / students.

**Interview Experience**

Your interview experience will mostly likely be similar to a product company interview but not as strict. There is a mixture of skill and attitude that is considered. But if you are a complete noob, don’t expect to be hired by a start-up as they can’t afford to train you fully. You need to have some experience in some field of CS. Be it data science, application development, web development or machine learning. This is to demonstrate your ability to learn independently.

**How to Prepare?**

Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on! Grab a field you are interested in, go about solving small problems. The problems you solve can be as small as writing a script to automatically book tickets for the latest Avengers movie or as complex as creating a robot that can extinguish fire autonomously. 

Get good or get out!

**Salary and Benefits**

The salary isn’t standard. It depends on how old the company is, how much funding they have and how many employees are there. So, you can’t put a range. It can be as low as a service based company pays, it can be higher than what a product based company pays.

The work environment will give you a lot of independence. The offices will be more employee-friendly, you will not have someone monitoring you like a watchman 24x7 and you will not have strict policies that you’ve to adhere too. Your manager and higher management will be more approachable if you ever need to discuss something.

But at the same time, there is responsibilities too. I am reiterating this because the kind of independence you get can be a bad thing if you are used to hand-holding. This is because hand-holding is done in every step of school and college in India, either by teachers, parents or peers! That might not necessarily be the case with start-ups.

I will be writing more on Skill development, freelancing, switching jobs, etc ! Stay tuned and let me know what you thought about this. :D",2019-04-24 03:22:51
"IFF submits comments to the Standing Committee on Science & Tech highlighting worries with the DNA Bill, 2019.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dygb7l/iff_submits_comments_to_the_standing_committee_on/,0,AskIndia,6,dygb7l,1574171489.0,InternetFreedomIn,"## 

https://preview.redd.it/d72pn1hu0lz31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4991e7d0a5538ee0d02b5efbffb901dcb86ffd34

## Tl;dr

The DNA Bill is back. The DNA Bill aims to regulate the use and outputs of DNA technology in certain cases and has been the subject of many a debate. It was introduced once again in July 2019 in the Lok Sabha after having lapsed in 2018. It was then referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change on October 18.  The Committee invited comments on the Bill till November 18 and oh, did we have a lot of comments.

## What's it all about?

India has been attempting to introduce legislation that regulates DNA technology since the early 2000's but thankfully has been largely unsuccessful until recently, making our fears quite real. The current DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 has seen a number of redrafts bringing it to its present form and yet continues to be problematic.

We're grateful to be able to voice these concerns as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change has invited comments on the Bill after it was referred to them. Unfortunately, as submissions made cannot be fully public prior to the Committee publishing their report, so we highlight our major concerns to give you an understanding of why we think the DNA Bill not only needs to undergo further work but also needs to be introduced only after a solid data protection law is in place.

## A few of our very many concerns

* *No data protection legislative framework*: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, the lack of obligation within the Bill to ensure protection especially by the DNA Laboratory as a either mere collectors or even processors of the DNA collected, have no alternative safeguards in place to remedy data breaches or ensure informed consent. Similarly, there is nothing to govern the sharing of such sensitive data, ensuring purpose limitation is maintained.
* *Profiling and surveillance:* DNA profiles can reveal extremely sensitive information about an individual such as their skin colour, illness, susceptibility to diseases and any access to such intrusive information can be misused to specifically target individuals with their own genetic data and is particularly worrying as it could be used to incorrectly link a particular caste/community to criminal activities. Further, in the event that such a databases are then linked to others worrying databases in existence, it is bound to give rise to Government conducted mass surveillance.
* *Overbroad provisions:* Our submission tackles the lack of legitimate use by the Bill; it indicates that DNA technology intends to be used for extremely wide criminal and civil purposes (**alarm bells are ringing**). We argue that the Bill as such extensive databasing of DNA data requires to meet the conditions set by the Supreme Court's judgement in Puttaswamy of which one is a greater public purpose, the databasing of DNA used in civil cases does not fulfill this criteria. Further, even within criminal cases, there is need to limit the collection of DNA to the investigation and prosecution of cognizable crimes to ensure the data in the DNA database is minimal and controlled.

The submission details a plethora of other concerns ranging from lack of privacy safeguards such as no informed consent, storage and sharing of information and the power of the DNA profiling board.

We are grateful that the Committee has invited non-official witnesses/experts to provide their views on November 27 and hope that both written and oral submissions that come their way will be taken into strong consideration, resulting in the suggestion of a much required revising of the Bill.

Why is learning programming the de facto advice in this sub?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biwylz/why_is_learning_programming_the_de_facto_advice/,57,AskIndia,146,biwylz,1556613311.0,WhereIsLifeTakingMe2,"Hi everyone! I am curious about the ground reality of people saying ""learn coding"" to get a job.

In this sub whenever I see a post that is made by a teenager struggling to find a job, be it people who already graduated, seniors in college or even freaking 12th grade students who couldn't get into prestigious colleges, people always seem to suggest them to try their hands on programming.

I feel this advice is misguided for anyone except college seniors. Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum. Seniors from other majors can pick up on this quickly as most of them have had an introductory class on computer science in their freshman year and have batchmates who are computer science majors. I have seen many non computer science majors being placed in reputed companies by ""learning coding"" in their senior year.

But when we talk about the ones who have already graduated, it becomes tremendously hard to gather resources and devote time to go through those courses. Even if someone does do that, I can't seem to understand on why a recruiter might trust you on your skills. Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company. I think unpaid internships would be a starter for this section of job seekers. But it would be a long term payout to get a paid job and I think one can definitely do a better job to get immediate returns rather than focusing on programming.

Finally, what made me write this post today is people suggesting it to someone who couldn't score well in JEE MAINS. Most probably the OP for that post hasn't had any prior introduction to programming. Doesn't this tantamount to society's misguided opinion of engineering/medical being the only path to success. Heck, we narrowed it down to programming on this sub. I do realise it is just a suggestion, but I feel this restricts him from exploring his own interests. Not scoring well in entrance exams could be a red herring that he is on the wrong path. Maybe that is what needs amends.

I would love to stand corrected on my views. Please share your opinions on why we collectively do so.

Thanks!",2019-04-30 14:05:11

Action-Packed Hearing in Facebook's Transfer Petition before the Supreme Court.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d8lb6i/actionpacked_hearing_in_facebooks_transfer/,2,AskIndia,38,d8lb6i,1569350050.0,InternetFreedomIn," 

https://preview.redd.it/vk8zcbb4sio31.jpg?width=389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b81169a3f60ecc89d246db99901cf18b1024cabb

**24 September 2019:** In today's hearing before the Supreme Court in Facebook's transfer petition seeking transfer of *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* from the Madras High Court to the Supreme Court, extensive arguments were made by the parties on whether technical and complex issues involving encryption should be addressed by the judiciary.

On 23.09.2019, IFF filed its response to Facebook's transfer petition and reiterated that while it believes such problems should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government, the Supreme Court should not curtail the jurisdiction of High Courts to entertain writ petitions by ordinary Indian internet users against large multinational tech companies. Ordinary Indian internet users residing in different parts of the country should be allowed to approach their State High Courts if their fundamental rights are violated by Big Tech because most Indians do not have the resources to initiate litigation in the Supreme Court. While we believe that the prayers in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* are misguided and strongly oppose any attempts to weaken encryption, it is also important to preserve access to justice for aggrieved citizens.

During today's hearing, the bench once again inquired about the status of the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules which have been in the pipeline since December 2018. The Counsel for the Central Government clarified that the policy formulation process was underway and ""special suggestions"" were being sought to revise the Rules. However, he stated that a specific timeline for notification of the Rules could not be provided. The Bench comprising of Deepak Gupta J. and Aniruddha Bose J. noted that while misuse of technology is a serious concern, such technical and complex issues are best addressed by the executive branch.

The Counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu insisted that WhatsApp was trying to avoid complying with Indian law by stating that it does not have the technology to identify the originator of information on its platform but this was not true since Dr. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras had provided a technical solution to enable tracing of originator. In response, Senior Advocate Mr. Kapil Sibal appearing for WhatsApp stated that another IIT Professor had disagreed with Dr. Kamakoti's proposed solution. This was a reference to the expert report by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran from IIT Bombay that IFF had previously filed before the Madras High Court. Read more about it [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-independent-expert-submission-before-madras-hc/).

After hearing these submissions, the Court noted that such complex issues need to be decided in consultation with technical experts and the judiciary cannot be expected to implement such changes. The Court emphasized that while policy formulation was within the domain of the executive, any policy formulated by the government is subject to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it does not undermine the right to privacy. Since the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules are being actively considered by the Government, the Court adjourned the matter till 22.10.2019. It further directed the Solicitor General to file an affidavit by the Secretary of MeitY within 3 weeks about the status of the Rules and provide a definite timeline about when the process will be completed.

IFF's Executive Director, Mr. Apar Gupta said the following about IFF's stance in today's hearing:

>""IFF represents Indian internet users and their fundamental rights, and not Big Tech. This requires us to take principled positions on what’s the best outcome possible in tough and complex situations.  
Ordinary internet users should have the ability to approach local judicial forums against Big Tech and will lack the financial capacity and resources to travel from remote places in India to judicial forums such as the Supreme Court of India at New Delhi.  This is separate from our substantive position which we have explained and our stance has been taken after considerable deliberation and inputs from our external team of lawyers.  
Just like we have filed a technical submission opposing traceability in the Hon'ble Madras High Court, we also opposed the transfer petition after receiving legal advice. According to us, it is best to contest the demand for traceability or social media regulations before the Hon'ble High Court. The High Court judgement will of course be subject to appeal if parties are aggrieved and the transfer petition is dismissed.    
Ultimately foregrounding all of this is our defense of the standards of the Shreya Singhal judgement. This is why we recommend that such complex questions that rest on technical aspects of computer science should be settled by executive and legislative processes rather than through courts. Any such legislative changes or regulations are also similarly open to judicial challenge if they undermine fundamental rights.""

The next hearing in the transfer petition is on 22 October 2019 and we will keep you updated about how this important case progresses. IFF was represented in today's hearing by Udayaditya Banerjee, Ria Singh Sawhney and S. Prasanna, and we are extremely grateful for their continued support.

"An Appeal: Please, do not jail PUBG users.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b0yd99/an_appeal_please_do_not_jail_pubg_users/,73,AskIndia,295,b0yd99,1552585621.0,InternetFreedomIn,"We cannot believe we are writing this. As per media reports which surfaced yesterday the Rajkot Police Department has arrested 7 youths for playing the PUBG online video game. Clearly things have spiralled out of control.

## A contested public debate

PUBG entered the mainstream lexicon in which the Hon'ble Prime Minister on January 29, 2019 while interacting with the concerns of a parent referred to it jovially. He clearly indicated in his remarks that, ""[*technology is a problem -- as well as a solution*](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/yeh-pubg-waala-hai-kya-pm-modi-aware-of-pubg-and-fortnite-addiction-offers-tips-on-how-to-deal-with-it-1442411-2019-01-30)"" and suggested patience and guidance as an approach for encouraging children to use their time productively. Alongside these remarks advisories were being issued by Child and Adolescent welfare bodies in some states including [Delhi](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/top-story/is-pubg-a-menace-delhi-child-rights-panel-says-game-negatively-impacts-kids/story/317245.html) and [Gujarat](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/pubg-addiction-gujarat-government-issues-notice-to-ban-students-from-playing-pubg-or-any-other-addictive-game/352324) that the game was addictive and could cause negative impacts on children even beyond their academic performance.

It is important to take a step back this moment and consider the wider academic literature on the subject. The top three cited meta studies on Google Scholar on the general impact of gaming on adolescents indicate varying outcomes. Some even suggest benefits such as development and improvement of hand eye co-ordination (*remember the old Atari's?*).

Yes, we may be completely wrong in an our inferences, but believe that this may be a matter for parental caution, and social debate but certainly not penal law. We explain the dangerous consequences of approaching this as a legal issue below.

## Prohibitory Order on playing PUBG

The Rajkot Police Commissioner has issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on March 6, 2019. A Section 144 order under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 is usually made to prevent illegal physical assemblies a breach of peace. While large numbers of online gamers do congregate and spend long hours in front of their smartphones or gaming consoles much to the annoyance of their friends and family such assemblies are rarely unlawful. It would be a stretch to call such activities as threatening public order.

Hence, we were surprised when a Kumar Manish posted this tweet:

We have today been able to have a [rough translation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xDu9OqcEmEq8fRupJmcORiJv0wfpVvR/view?usp=sharing) prepared in English thanks to the help offered by Manan Bhatt.

From reading the prohibitory order, it is reasonable to infer that as per press reports, 7 youths ranging from the ages of 19 to 26 have been arrested for the breach of this prohibitory order. At this point we found ourselves bewildered and taken aback as this is seemingly a grave attack on personal liberty. We believe as the Hon'ble Prime Minister noted in his conversation that concerns on online gaming are better handled with the care and affection of a parent and teachers. Certainly not by creating fear of penal law, through prohibitory orders issued by the police and subsequent arrests. This is not only abhorrent to sensibility but offends our core fundamental rights as it lacks rationality and the reasonableness necessary in any restriction imposed by the State.

In the coming days we will be sourcing and authenticating information and taking steps including talking to a legal team based out of Gujarat. We hope to address this issue responsibly and meanwhile urge the Gujarat government to look into this matter urgently. We appeal to them -- *jailing people should not be a game*.

[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/,6,AskIndia,16,ctzkd1,1566518998.0,throwaway93681,"This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML & CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday. This shit has been so sickening lately that I've started doubting that it's just me who the real asshole here is.",2019-08-23 05:39:58
[Guide] Building your resume while in college as a CS Engineering student [Part 1 / 4],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c87jbg/guide_building_your_resume_while_in_college_as_a/,13,AskIndia,32,c87jbg,1562091562.0,RejectedCoder,"This is a guide that I wanted to write since a long time and I was inspired by a post written about college placements on this forum. The end goal of this guide would be to land you a job at a product based company. The pre-requisites are that you should not hate coding and you need to know a programming language / at least have the determination to learn.

I will be constructing this guide as a whole for the 4 years that you will be in engineering. Feel free to skip some or add anything extra if you feel the need to. I've been writing drafts for this post since a week and have tried to organize my thoughts, but excuse any disorganization :)

This guide might help you if you check these boxes:

* A computer science student (preferably a newbie)
* Still in college (preferably in 1st year)
* Have a zeal to excel in the field and get relevant jobs.
* Have a blank resume with respect to your engineering degree.

**Stage 0 : Pre-work**

If you are very new to college, the odds are you are either severely depressed because of the achievements of people around you or you are overly enthusiastic for a new beginning or you are just unaffected by college. All of those are okay. If you are in the basket where you are scared of people boasting off about their achievement in the first year of college, don't worry! It doesn't matter what others do as long as you do what you can do and a lot of people who boast do not possess the expertise they think they posses. However, if you feel out of place, do DM me. We can have a chat.

In the pre-work phase, one has to understand their college and how things work in their college. This is best done in first year, before your first summer vacation. Most of the colleges have cells or clubs that have some sort of active projects. You need to talk to people, go through the college website and find out about these clubs. These clubs can be student-run or it can be run by a group of professors. You should be looking at the latter as they have well defined problem statements that they'd be working on and you've better chances of getting good exposure working on these projects.

Make a list of all the clubs that are there. Know about the procedure to get into each of these clubs, the projects they are offering / have previously done and who is the contact point. From these clubs, pick any of the interesting clubs/projects and set a goal to work towards developing skills that would help in those projects.

A personal recommendation would be to avoid highly specific clubs i.e. if a club is focusing on one problem statement that it is trying to solve since a few years it might not be the ideal place for a newbie to join. Smaller problem statements are good.

At the end of this stage, you must have a goal to be a part of one (or multiple) clubs during your first summer break.

**Stage 1 : Year 1**

In the first year, you will be under a common branch and your subjects will be science-related and not field-related. You might have 1 subject each semester that relates to your field, but I am not sure how much of help that would be as the teachers would be teaching the subject to non-CS people too. However, they will be introductory programming classes and its good to focus during these classes. If you don't find them helpful, read on.

We will divide the 12 months of first year into 3 quarters. 

1. Spend the first three months into learning at least one programming language. 
2. In your second three months, you should be able to read code and implement a few things. Then, pickup a programming language like C++ / Java. 
3. In your third quarter, you should look at trying to test your learning by implementing something useful. It can be small, it can be something that's already there, but do try to implement it from scratch by yourself.

Let me elaborate all three stages clearly.  


**Stage 1.1 : First Quarter, First Year - Learning a programming language**  
Python is an easy programming language to start off. You can also start off with C/C++/Java if you really want to skip a few steps, but I would ideally suggest you start off with Python. Learning resources like Hackerrank Language course, Automate The Boring Stuff e-book, some long Youtube tutorials and Learn Python The Hard Way ebook should be of help.  
Note : You should not aim to finish all 4 sources as that is not practically possible in three months. Follow a breadth first learning approach where you read a little and write a little. 

A good step to start off would be to aim to get 4 stars on Hackerrank's Python course to get a good grasp of the syntax. You should be familiar with indentation, for loops, if-else ladders, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries and optionally, list comprehension. During your course, if you feel like something isn't clearly explained in Hackerrank, navigate to that section of Learn Python The Hard Way and refer it.

At this stage, you are comfortable with reading and writing Python, not explore Automate The Boring Stuff and try implementing some of the tasks given there. (I am looking at something that is onwards from chapter 8 of that book).

Alternatively, you can also watch and implement code from hour long Youtube tutorials that make promise to make you a hero from a zero in Python. But this looks like a hack that isn't rewarding because you are quite literally copy-typing the code that the Youtuber has written.

**Stage 1.2 : Second Quarter, First year - Implement & Learn OOP**

Many companies in the outside market look for Object Oriented Programming as a skill. After writing Python code, you are probably going to curse Java/C++ and will skip it completely because you won't believe how relevant these languages are in the market. This is one of the most common mistakes people do, but at the end they'd have to end up learning at least one of these languages. If you are taking up Java, I'd recommend [Derek Banas' Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) on youtube. You'd be coding what he's coding, but if you understand your code that is good enough. Learn about data structures in java (List, Set, etc) and learn about Iterators, Object Oriented Design Principles (Inheritance, Interface, Extension, etc). If you are looking for something smaller, [try this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/). 

Similar courses exist for C++ also, so do your homework.

**Stage 1.3 : Third Quarter, First Year - Build something small**

So, now you know Python and to some extent Java. You've two paths from here. One is build something using Python/Java or second, learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript and build something with that. It can be something as small as a script receiving some data from an API and putting it in an excel sheet, or a calculator. The idea of this experiment is to check how fast you can build things. Once it is suitably built, you will have to write test cases. If you think it is too early to write test cases, list test cases on an Excel/Google Sheet and start testing your code for boundary cases.

For instance, if you have written a code that takes in a Reddit Thread as an input, gathers all the comments, checks the age of the accounts on all parent comments and returns some analytics (say, how many accounts are < 1 month old, less than 1 year old, etc) on it. You will need to handle test cases where your internet isn't working, the URL is wrong, you can't parse because your authentication token to Reddit API is wrong, the thread URL is wrong, etc. Basically, everything that you can think of.   


**FAQ**

> Should I get an internship in the first year?

Ideally, I wouldn't recommend an internship. Work with personal projects / college projects / skill development. Most of the internships given out to first year students are petty work that would be wasting time. Its much easier to put this in 2nd year when you will have a strong(er) resume.

> Should I specialize in one field?

No. Personally, a lot of students restrict themselves to learning only the buzzword fields, which is wrong. What is a buzzword today might have no relevance tomorrow. Focus on learning to learn, than learning one technology or one area. Initially, learn a little bit of a lot of things and slowly specialize into a field. That way, if your specialization does not click in the market, you always have a strong fundamental to pick something else up.

> Should I do problem solving?

Personally, I would say yes. But it is optional. I feel first year is too early to dive into algorithms and data structures even though a lot of colleges do teach basics of these. If you are really interested, you can definitely spend some time everyday in solving problems on Hackerrank / Leetcode / InterviewBit. But don't overdo it.

Any other question w.r.t first year, please do ask below. I will keep updating the post with interesting questions.

I will be writing Part 2 by Friday, did not want to make it very long and I wanted to keep discussions relevant to the first year of engineering itself.",2019-07-02 23:49:22

They are extremely difficult to control/manage as they do not get affected by commonly used/usable pesticides or conventional farming techniques.

1 **What is Fall ArmyWorm?** - [Wiki link here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_armyworm)

Below quote is from [The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations ](http://www.fao.org/fall-armyworm/en/)

>The Fall Armyworm (FAW), or Spodoptera frugiperda, is an insect that is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. In the absence of natural control or good management, it can cause significant damage to crops. It prefers maize, but can feed on more than 80 additional species of crops, including rice, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetable crops and cotton. **FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 and has quickly spread across virtually all of Sub-Saharan Africa. In July 2018 it was confirmed in India and Yemen**.

2 **DownToEarth.org has studied and covered the FAW effects in India** - [Article here](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/agriculture/fall-armyworm-attack-the-damage-done-63445)

(*DownToEarth is an fortnightly magazine, produced by an India based NGO Centre for Science and Environment*)

> * By the time the infestation was detected, it had already become malignant. Khemo Baghel, a farmer of Bade Chakwa village in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district, took up maize cultivation for the first time early this year. He dug a borewell and was convinced that the return from maize would be better than any other crop. But hardly had the seeds sprouted, he saw some keedas (worms) slowly colonising his farm. “I detected them one morning. There was no trace of them the previous day. I think they landed at night,” he narrates. Within two months, the keedas had a firm grip on his farm, taking away 30 per cent of his maize crop. 

> * Now agriculture scientists and extension officers frequent Bade Chakwa and neighbouring villages and they too are puzzled. But by now, the outlier has a local name: “American keeda”.

> * In Palari village, the American keeda has damaged the entire maize crop. “I have been farming for four to five years, but have never noticed this insect. **Pesticides are not effective on them**,” says Parmeshwar Pandey.

> * In just nine months since FAW was spotted in India in Karnataka last June, it has invaded crops in over 10 states. As if taking a pre-scripted route, FAW infestation has spread from Karnataka to all southern states; then to western Maharashtra and Gujarat; and now to eastern states

> * Besides advancing fast, the pest is also attacking new crops. Though it is being detected mostly in maize crops—a preliminary calculation estimates it has affected nearly 170,000 hectares (ha) of maize crops—there have been reports from states where it has infested paddy, sugarcane and sweet corn. 

> * **Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice and wheat. It accounts for 9 per cent of the total food grain production in the country.**


> * In Andhra Pradesh’s Institute of Frontier Technology — an affiliate of the Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) in Tirupati — crop researchers are a worried lot as the news of infestation has turned from a trickle to a deluge. It was first identified in Andhra Pradesh in August 2018 when it affected maize growing areas of East and West Godavari districts, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. **“With maize seed production being a major crop in Godavari district, it can have serious economic consequences. Being a major ingredient for the poultry and cattle feed, production losses in maize could cripple meat and milk production**,” says M John Sudheer, principal scientist at ANGRAU.

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I know that I have a goal. Which is to get a good coding related job. But I don't know how to get to that goal. Nor which technology I should get into. So please help me decide.",2019-07-13 06:53:58

My branch is environmental engineering, I chose it by mistake and honestly have no interest in it neither it is a good career to persue in India because of less jobs and low salary. I have interest in Computer Science and wish to persue it as my career. So I have 2 options  at the moment. Study CS on my own and try to land an off campus job which is very dificult I've heard from seniors, or I could take admission in DU in BSc computer science this year in colleges like SSCBS or Hansraj. My 12th percentage was 94.75% and I have already cleared the sscbs cutoff, and might also clear the Hansraj cutoff in upcoming lists.
My aim is land a well paying  job after college. DTU has a lot of non tech placements in analyst/consulting roles which are open for all branches and most non Cs students opt for that. I don't know much about that field and if it is right for me or not.
If I go for DU colleges, they don't have good placements after Bsc and one would have to go for masters like MBA/Ms in India or abroad.
What should I do? Continue in DTU or join Hansraj or SSCBS?

Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bn13id/need_for_a_change_of_school_culture_and_the_hype/,8,AskIndia,36,bn13id,1557537972.0,sebthestudent,"I am currently a Ph.D. in Biology student at a university in the United States of America. I completed my class 10th in 2006, and my class 12th in 2008. I scored 78.3% and 72% in the aforementioned board exams, respectively. During my school years, I was never a meritorious student. I was rather among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section academically. However, I worked really hard for my class 10th board exam and was deeply affected by the final percentage I scored. I did pretty well in the mock exams that I used to give at the private tuition center I took to help my academic performance and scored much more than many of friends majority of whom ended up scoring more than 85% in the final board examination.

&#x200B;

Till my class 10th, I studied at a prestigious public school in Delhi. As per the school's rule, a student could only be offered Science, if he/she scored more than 80% in English, Science, and Mathematics combined. My score was 77.7%, and therefore, was offered humanities and commerce. The rule didn't make sense as I scored 94% in Science, and my mathematics scores were always among the top 5-15% of the high scoring students in my section.  Therefore, I changed schools to study Science, and today I am earning a top-most degree in a field in which my school thought I was not a good fit.

&#x200B;

I suffered from depression and lack of confidence before my class 10th. I used to be good at cricket, but I suffered in that as well. My school carried a culture where if you are not good academically, then you are hopeless in other extra-curricular activities as well. I wanted to do academically well in school (prior to my class 10th), but the lack of confidence made it really difficult to come out of the shell and raise myself to glory (yes, being a good student did seem like a glory). I was so terrified that I would be scared to even open my textbooks.

&#x200B;

Not being able to get Science made things worse. I lost even more hope, and this worsened my mental health for my class 12th board exam. I remember praying to score at least more than 60% a night before the results. But, today if I could talk to my younger self, my recommendation would be to not lose hope and enjoy doing what you like. However, I still not sure if the environment that I lived would help. In my school days, I was compelled to feel like an outlaw for being among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section.

&#x200B;

Recently, an article came out on Hindu, about a mother congratulating her son for scoring 60% in class 10th. She says that she had seen her son struggle to the point of giving up, and therefore, was proud of the final scores he got. In my time, my parents were also in full support of me. So was my father, who had always been strict. My father would never come to the parents-teachers meeting, as I was not up to the standards he expected of me. But, after my class 10th, he was very supportive and backed me at every point possible. Getting this sort of support from this person was huge for me then. He tried his level best to make a case to my school principal as to why I deserve to be a science student for the last two years of schooling. But, I remember walking down the school corridor with my parents trying to make a last attempt to convince my school principal, I met my Geography teacher. She congratulated me sarcastically and ridiculed me (in front of my parents) of how bad of a student I was before. It has been 13 years since that gesture, but the instance is still registered in my memory from word to word.

&#x200B;

Therefore, this makes me wonder, whether how much of a support system would your parents be if you have such teachers and cultures inculcated in schools. At that time, my parent's support didn't help me much. In fact, it made me feel even more horrible for being responsible for letting them go through such tough situations. Manier times. especially I like to believe in my case, low scores in class 10th are due to a stroke of sheer bad luck. But, the impact is grave for a naive 16-year-old.

&#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that in addition to having a good support system from one's parents, the school's culture of dealing with young students needs to change. Teachers have a big responsibility of training future entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers etc, and therefore need to pay proper regard to a students self-esteem and self-confidence. What might just seem to be a simple comment (and here I don't include the personal issues that teacher might sometime have) the repercussions on the student's mental health might be huge.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I got to know about this below-given news article from the same geography teacher's Facebook post. She was cheering this wonderful mother for her attempt to lift the pressure off the head of her son' young mind. I first felt like commenting directly about the hypocrisy she has shown to me at the least. But, I think I should probably try to let this memory go of my head and move on.

Now, my university is going to force me to take their summer training on web development which is the thing that I totally hate. My SGPA is 8.76 as I focused more studies and less on learning any specific technology. I have some projects but, only one big project in which I developed a program for the tech event that was hosted in our university. 

My area of interests are Data Science, Computer Vision, and Psychology. I tried to get into Data Science but, seniors said that learn Mathematics first. When I tried Computer vision, they said learn linear algebra first. So, I started learning linear algebra as well. So, now I am just banging head over books.  I don't know what to do, I am stuck. 

I don't want to waste my summer attending something that I am not interested in, please guide me.

Advice needed for B-School.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccqp9z/advice_needed_for_bschool/,1,AskIndia,9,ccqp9z,1563061233.0,Ash_Sss,"I am doing a Bsc in Information Technology from a reputed college, placements are decent in our college, last year average was 4.5 lacs and highest was 18 lacs, this sounds pretty good for a college with very low fees but i don't see myself doing something in IT field, i cleared the entrances for VIT,KIIT,SRM,Manipal,COMEDK and few others but i did not join any of them for the very same reason, i was pushed into science by my parents and they were also forcing me to join KIIT(which i still can join) but i convinced them somehow for a Bsc as placements in KIIT were not as tempting as they had expected. I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

&#x200B;

Now these are my questions :-

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

&#x200B;

If not top IIMs, i can surely get in top 10 schools.

&#x200B;

P.S - 1)My parents wanted me to do graduation only in CS,IT or Electronics, i have also cleared few entrances for BBA.

2) Money is not a problem, i'm open to all suggestions.

3) I want to go for a degree just after Bsc and don't want to work.",2019-07-14 05:10:33

I am just acknowledging the wide gap. 

Today I woke up to a tweet by IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad which showed a robot called Mitra made by an Indian company. The robot looked amusingly simple, like a bigger version of the toys I had as a child. See it here: 

> Nice to meet Mitra- the robot during Goa IT day that has been developed by an Indian startup. #DigitalIndia

> https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1018473949229826048?s=09

I was intrigued and searched for it. I came across this video which shows the same robot greeting Ivanka Trump when she visited India. The robot enters with drumbeats:

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_irZMn5JeB0

The only function this robot could do was roll around with remote control and respond to a simple touch screen press. It kind of failed the second task because the maker did not think the process through (PM and Ivanka both press the button together and it got stuck on the next screen). This is the technology we were showcasing to the world.

On the other hand, we have Boston Dynamics. I remember seeing their Big Dog robot almost a decade back and it had blown my mind back then. See how it corrects itself even after being kicked:

There are various categories in this kind of management. For example, technology, packaging, research (citizen science) or just awareness. What according to you does India need right now?

Organisations like silverzone and SOF are ruining the prestige of olympiads in India.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8r87e7/organisations_like_silverzone_and_sof_are_ruining/,53,AskIndia,188,8r87e7,1529065445.0,thescoobynooby,"As most of you DO NOT know, there are 6 major olympiads organised for school students (there are 12 major science olympiads, but these 6 offer the most incentives).

These are->

1) International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)

2) International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)

3) International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)

4) International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO)

5) International Astronomy Olympiad (IAO)

6) International Olympiad of Linguistics (IOL)

All of these are extremely prestigious olympiads, which one can not take part in directly. They have various stages in which they sieve out children, and in the end a team of 4-6 children represents a country in these international olympiads. Olympiads organised by silverzone/SOF are misdirecting people into a false sense of prestige, and are making big bucks doing so. They sell admit cards, workbooks, text books, past year papers and whatnot. They even go as far as to copy the names of these olympiads exactly as they are.

Here's an incident: A friend of mine is an IMO bronze medallist, and he shared this fact one day with his relatives. His aunt was quick to respond that her daughter was in fact a gold medal holder in IMO. When he asked which year was the IMO, and where it was held, she told him that the olympiad took place in her daughter's school just a week ago. Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Just wanted to let out this quick rant. Dont waste your money on these hoax olympiads, and then go on and brag about how your child is a gold medal holder.

A few colleges in India offer admission on the basis of participation in these olympiads, and I was shocked when people from silverzone/SOF olympiads were lining up to claim their seats. Needless to say, they all got rejected, but what was even sadder is that they did not even know about the big 6 olympiads.

If you have been selected into the training camp of any of these 6 olympiads, you can get admission to Chennai Mathematical Institute(one of the best mathematics school in india) and IIIT-H(International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad). You are also selected for an interview at ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) if you have been a member of IMO-TC(training camp for IMO). These are some of the incentives to participate in these olympiads.

EDIT: correction, IMO was held in India once in 1996

EDIT2: India actually participates in almost all the major olympiads.",2018-06-15 17:54:05

**Childhood in my Hood, Spider-Man and INS DEGA**

As you can see, I am from Vizag. I was brought up and still live in the middle of an Industrial-Estate. My entire childhood revolved around [all sort of machines]( https://imgur.com/a/EdN3Xvj), machinery and welding sparks coming from the never ending fabrication works that went on in the hood. This sort of environment made me a naturally curious kid thanks to my dad and Uncle who both hold a Diploma in Mechanical Engineer for choosing the right neighbourhood. All my questions regarding these machines were nicely answered by my father and that in turn made me more interested in how things worked. This got a boost when I first met [*Spider-Man* and his amazing friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FJNBRP8P0). This show and other Sider-Man shows had a huge impact on me, so much so that I used to play with common house spiders in hopes that its bite would turn me into a Spider-Man. Thanks to Universe, venomous spiders are not that common in a typical Urban Indian household I guess, I’m still alive and well. Besides that stupidity, Spider-Man being a student of science and using science to solve problems or for fighting villains made me interested in sciences and I started to pay attention in classes and made me question and think about things in universe and nature. This helped me have good foundation in Maths and General Sciences. 

On the other hand, our neighbourhood is in the close vicinity of a Naval Airport, INS DEGA. This helped me develop a love for things that fly. Our Neighbourhood used to be perfectly aligned with the runway path of the airport, this gave me really up close view of the planes touching down and taking off of the airport. Being a Defense airport there were special aircrafts in addition to the commercial ones. Navy Week was and still is the best season for some flight watching. At the age of 11, this interest in flying things pushed me to apply the science I learnt in school to make an object that fly with the help of DC motors it failed, of course. But that failure has set the path which I would follow in my higher studies. My father introduced me to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who has been a huge inspiration. I may not know the name of the degree but I decided to study the science of flight and how to build things that fly. That was the idea of a child. 

**Finding an admission for Undergrad, IITM- Shaastra 07 & 08, Job Hunt & Masters in UK**

I was good theoretically but competitive exams are not my thing. I knew, I wouldn’t succeed neither in JEE nor AIEEE so any dreams of doing Aerospace/Aeronautical Engineering were smashed, my parents are kind enough to not force me into that machinery and left me to my choice for EAMCET. I just have to get a Mechanical Engineering seat in Andhra University or GITAM. That’s good enough for me because, Mechanical engineering also covers the science of flight and these two are the best engineering schools of my city and I don’t have to leave town if got an admit. 

So I found myself in GITAM, it has been a fun ride there. I always loved hands on jobs since I am a kid. I love to build something or do something with my hands. In second year of undergrad I attended Shaastra’ 07 at IIT MADRAS and it changed my outlook on engineering as a whole. I was awed by the students who built and gave a demo of the [VTOL flight built by them, Team YU-FLY?]( https://imgur.com/a/jj7DiUk) It was the coolest thing I saw. It was when I started taking an interest in research and technological developments in my field and in general. Target was set to Shaastra 08, me and my childhood friends made a contraption built by our own hands using a lot of Jugaad and tools found from the hood. Have a look here [GIF 1]( https://gfycat.com/KnobbyCompetentBear), [GIF 2]( https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableDefenselessIberianmidwifetoad). That was the demo video we sent in with the abstract. We are the Mighty mavericks but we got of Lots of weak links in the plan and it worked only partially. This set the stage for my participation in a series of technical events that I would attend over the last two years of my Undergrad. 

My communication skills were really bad by the end of Undergrad and this meant I wasn’t doing good in the Campus Interviews. I only wanted to join a core company and I couldn’t find any. I did the 5 day assessment for technical engineer post in IAF but didn’t make that list too. Couldn’t get a good rank in GATE. But found myself an admission at a really good Mechanical Engineering School in UK. Education Loan was the only way I could afford this and my parents had to put our house on the line to get a loan. EDWISE has given me immigration support free of cost as I secured my own admission. Went to UK and finished my degree, visited London twice and returned home. That’s it. I did not make much contact with the life in UK, its land and its culture. I was limited by time and money. But with the help of High-speed internet, I did learn a lot about world, science and technology, history and was introduced to reddit, student guilds, game of thrones and a whole lot of popular culture through university life. This helped with my English and subsequently my communication skills.

**Shock after returning home**

After finishing the degree, I returned home only to find that the degree I just received is not valid in India. Even a private engineering college didn’t want to hire me as a lecturer because my degree is not considered a Master’s Degree. That was a huge blow to me. I had to look for opportunities abroad again. Thanks to my thesis supervisor in UK, a well-known name in his field, gave me a good recommendation letter which helped me secure a full scholarship to do doctoral research in Australia. I was so happy and my parents were really proud of me.

**My way Down Under and How life changed there: RA Job, Research and Cooking**

I never thought I’d end up in Australia of all places. I went there with no expectations and the first few months have been the most difficult months. Then I made friends at student housing, who pushed me to apply for RA position and that changed a lot of things. I got the position and during my term I would be promoted to a senior RA and would organize the best parties and events over the next couple of years. This gave me a huge exposure to Aussie, International students and cultures from around the world. I had to be outgoing for the job so I became an outgoing person. [My love for cooking, adventure, camping and off road driving]( https://imgur.com/a/w6k2kIk) helped me go to some of the remote parts of Australia and make some amazing friends along the way. People around me at uni and housing were mostly younger than me, were not judgemental at all and I could do what I want without fear of judgement. I was earning good money while having the best time of my life and cleared my education loan in no time. [Perfect song to describe my time down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpjvJdomfM) 

My research on the other hand was not going as expected. I am a hands-on person and I always enjoyed experimental work rather than simulations or numerical work. My research problem has been changed by supervisor from being heavily based on experiments to one that was half cooked right from the beginning which consisted mostly of Numerical work and only some namesake validation by experimental work. On top of that one of supervisor who is supposed to help me with Numerical work has moved to another university in another country all together and I was left with a supervisor who is Experimental guy guiding me on numerical work. From there it was a downward spiral and I ended up losing interest in the research I was doing. I produced two papers which in my opinion are not really great. 

On a parallel, I was doing really well as a RA, was cooking and trying some amazing recipes to whole lot of people from around the world and at one point [I cooked Indian food entirely made from scratch for the entire student village of 300 students](https://imgur.com/a/NqswIa9). Since I was a kid, I loved cooking and it was a life-long dream to own a restaurant someday and this idea was there in the back of my head all the time. And when it came to point where I can no longer continue my research work due to various reasons and I had to make a decision to change my line of work. It wasn’t easy, I had to consider so many things into account and had to find the confidence that I can cook commercially. 

**First Job in a Commercial Kitchen and How I found myself in a Road trip**

So I went searching for a job in a commercial Kitchen. After a lot of failed attempts, I went door to door along a popular coffee strip giving out [my new culinary resume](https://imgur.com/a/xVMIt9s) which I had to make up using the things I did so far. I got a call back from a Chef who loved my resume, my passion for the craft of cooking and gave me a job in his kitchen. Being the only computer literate among the staff I got to know the ropes of making stock lists, recipe cards, the numbers behind making a menu and running a commercial kitchen basically /r/kitchenconfidential. This gave me the confidence I needed. 

I rented a big motorcycle above 700CC which I always wanted to drive and just left for a drive. I covered 1400 KM in next two days along the southwest corner of Australia. This journey gave me the opportunity be with myself, think about myself and helped me come to a decision on so many things I wanted to do in life. The trip was really dangerous, I was driving 130-120 KMPH because I only rented the bike for two days and wanted to make the most out of it, I cannot lose sight of the road ahead because if I hit a kangaroo or things crossing the roads I’d crash at high speed and before I know it I’d be dead as Australia being so huge it would take hours for someone to notice me or get me to help. This fear for life made me so vigilant, self-aware and made me concentrate on the road like I never did before and that too hours on end. I was a different person at the end of this trip. I am not even exaggerating on this one. I felt like I conquered all my fears in life.

It was clear to me; I just had to do what makes me happy. I quit my research, quit the job in the kitchen and was finally on my way back home with the most daunting task ahead,  telling my parents about it, convincing them to help me start a Food Truck and to believe in my dream. After all is said and done, they still don’t get why I am doing this but decided to support my cause. 

**My Friend**

I could not do this alone; I needed a partner to do this with. The first person I got in mind was my lifelong friend. We went to same school since kindergarten and grew up together in the same neighbourhood and in a way we see thing uniquely in our own ways. He was not a brilliant student in class but he was the best when it comes to real world, he is creative, he can see things which no one else can in places nobody else even looks. He is brave and always helped me with my phobia for dogs; he has been a huge support in my life. I spoke to him regarding this and he immediately wanted to join me. He quit his job in Mumbai and came back to our city. He has his share of troubles at home, more than me and for that I really admire him for believing in my dream and to make this decision to join me on this journey.  

**Straight Outta Vizag**
	
I named our little venture Straight Outta Vizag because I truly believe this city has shaped my life so much, in a way it defines me and for that I love my city like how Peter Parker loves his city, New York. Although we are not the webbed vigilante we too try to do some good in our city. For our first socio-event, thanks to my sister and Good Universe, a NGO, [we organised an awareness campaign on women’s health in our neighbourhood](https://imgur.com/a/uKaRy2d) and it was a grand success. 

We started operations with this [Menu](https://imgur.com/a/WIlbGXU) and was getting a  good response. Then, Kerala floods happened so we decided to donate our earnings during this run towards the Kerala flood relief activities as you can see from our post history.

**Cold hands of the City governing bodies**

No matter how good our intentions are, we are not welcomed in the city. Before going on road, we went to various government offices like, Food safety and standards, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation- GVMC and its Public Health wing, City Police and Fire Department to get permission according to this [Notification by Hyderabad City Police](http://www.ctp.gov.in/PressNote/NotificationFoodCourtVehiclePermission.pdf), I found online. It appears so that, none of the people I met have no idea if such a regulation existed in my City, Vizag. No one official has given us direction with this regard. No one has responded to us properly, most of the people claim that no one has come to them like us, asking permission to put up a food truck and that they won’t allow it, mostly because they haven’t done that before. But there are lot of food trucks running in the city. 

[I submitted a letter to the Commissioner, GVMC]( https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) in May but got no response even after all these months so we started operations with only a FSSAI license in hand. Where ever we go Police or the GVMC personnel has asked us to remove the truck. Why are other trucks allowed then? Later I learned that other food truck people formed into Unions area-wise and are running things according to their made up rules within the area like a “dhandha”. Why do I have to join a union of a particular place or all the places if I intend to set-up my truck?

**More Social Activism**

During the month of August 2018, we had rains for a couple of days and our street got flooded due to improper storm drains. We have had this issue for ages and our colony people have approached the municipality but nothing was done. In lieu of this, we brought it to the notice of [GVMC commissioner through an open letter](https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) on our facebook and twitter profiles, which talks not just about our problems in the hood but also other problems that I have seen in my city. This time we got a response but I did not mention my problems with the permits because it didn’t seem right to plug the same with problems in the hood and my city. 

GVMC responded promptly and started the restoration of storm drain works in September and finished the work during the second week of November. Due to these works happening we had to put a comma to our operations and resumed our work during third week of November. 

**What happened after we are back on road…**

This time we wanted to try a healthy breakfast menu and we set up shop on the way between VUDA Park and YSR statue Roundabout on the beach road. We were asked to vacate the place by an Assistant City Planning officer from GVMC Zone II. The next day we moved to parking in front of YMCA on beach road and two days later, this time, a sanitation inspector warns us not to put up the truck and it will be seized if we do so again. So we removed the truck and went to meet the GVMC Zone-II commissioner, Mr. Palli Nallanayya. Here’s how our interaction went by: 

Me n My friend walk into commissioner’s room who appeared to be in a staff meeting. 

Me – ‘trying to hand him the letter we already submitted to GVMC’-- utters the words: “Sir, memu food truck okati start chesam mee...” “Sir, we are starting a food truck…”
He cut me off there and with a growing frown on his face he just utters the word “ivvamu”... “Alantivi ivvamu ma zone Lo” “Stop it there, we will not give you a permit. We don’t do this sort of thing in our Zone.”

Looking at his body language and the way he didn’t even bother to hear what we have to say made me sick and we left the room. 

Because of these obstacles we are now without a proper location for our truck. Many have suggested me ways to get a contact in GVMC who knows “how to get things done” But I do not want to go that route because it is not the right way to do it and as stupid as I am I will fight for what is right and we are planning to meet the commissioner regarding this and File a RTI with GVMC and City Police regarding what they know about already existing food trucks. Meanwhile, we found some gigs with adventure agencies and started arranging food for trekking and camping events in our beautiful and untapped eastern ghats.  We also cater to small parties, family gatherings, speciality events, college get-togethers and many more. We met some amazing people along the way, particularly youngsters who seem to respect and admire what we are trying to do which in turn gave us energy to continue on our journey. We intend to bring cooking and the joy of making food closer to our patrons and give them a well-rounded dining experience wherever they choose to eat.  

Our city has so much to offer in terms of tourism. Our tourism potential is not fully tapped into and we want to promote our city tourism which will help create jobs in the local communities. I cordially invite any and all off you folks that love a good beach or a view from a hill, come visit our city, Vizag. If you choose to hire us we can take you around and accompany you with good food and present you with some amazing views that are unique to our city and it’s geography. As the songs goes... [Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'? How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjCoKslQOEs)


I’m sharing this with the reddit community because it is a unique platform compared to other social networking sites and the people, stories from reddit have inspired me a lot and helped me develop as person. And by sharing this I would like inform the community about us and hope that our story may inspire someone else in realizing their own dreams. Also, to reach out to a lot of people who barely know about our City in terms of a travel destination and to reach out artists, content creators, travel bloggers and to collaborate with anyone who is interested in enjoying good food and nature. Do have a look at us, know about us and if possible inform your friends about us. See you on the road. Meanwhile here’s [some pics of our truck, menus we did and of places you can visit in and around Vizag.](https://imgur.com/a/lAHV5Xj)

It's truly mind-blowing what OP has suggested.

Basically, this model has been there since 19th century and it was used to discipline kids and make them obedience.There has been no change ever since.Even though literacy rates of the west are higher,the quality of education has made many students drop out because it doesn't promote any creativity or critical thinking.The side effects of this are depression,ADHD and living unproductive life,of course.

What do you think of the solution they suggested?Do you want to add something to solution?

> ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

> Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
> 
> Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",2019-02-22 12:06:01

Here I'm posting it again. It's about climate i promise, nations are included as relevance and examples for my arguments, not for personal attacks.
My previous [post is archived here.] (https://www.scribd.com/document/387542089/Enjoying-summers-Me-too-s)

I'm from Northern part of India, this little state once upon a time called as breadbasket of India, you guessed it, Punjab.  It might have lost its charm over the years but it's still one of the best place to live in India except one thing: The weather.  

I loathe the weather here, leave aside the first 4 weeks, it's literally a swamp for rest of the year, unbearably hot and humid. As a kid who grew up in Amritsar, I remember when i used to play in the fields outside my house in the monsoons, The fields are covered in concrete now. 

Fast-forward to today, I'm now an adult aged 19. My body has gained mass and stature of a man but what it hasn't gained is Mr. Freeze's Freeze-Ray to keep my cerebral cortex cool. Unless you stay inside an air-conditioned environment or wear some alien OptiTemp suit, you can't stop the heat from bogging down your cognitive functions. It's a fact!

Peak of human Intelligence seldom can be achieved in hot humid climates hence the IQ disparity between the inhabitants of temperate and tropical regions. 

Almost all developed nations are in the temperate zone barring Russia and North Korea (due to decades of Communist mismanagement). Tropical regions are mostly poor except for Bangalore-sized tiny nations like Abu Dhabi (Oil), Singapore (strategic sea hub location) etc.

If you compare within countries in the temperate zone, there's an intellectual divide between their northern and southern regions. Take Italy for example, Southern Italy is comparatively more corrupt and poor than Northern Italy. As such there's a clear correlation between climate and intelligence. This holds true for USA and Japan too. These are wealthy nations who can afford to run AC 24x7.

According to the Cold Winter theory by Richard Lynn,  Ancestors of Europeans and North-East Asians faced extreme winters thus higher intelligence would've evolved and those who didn't develop intellect, perished. Going by this, Eskimos should have the highest IQ on Earth which isn't the case but wait, the author has something to say about it.

    ""Lynn  (CWT, p. 144)  argued that high intelligence can  only  
    evolve in  large populations because mutations, being chance 
    events, are more  likely to occur in large populations. Arctic
    people have smaller  populations than Asians or Europeans and
    therefore mutations beneficial to intelligence did not occur.""

Well, intelligence is a complex topic and it is influenced by host of factors like genetics, culture, birth environment etc. Cold weather is beneficial for brain and yields the easiest intelligence boost without winning a genetic lottery. 

The energy required for cooling human body is greater than warming it up. Also, the brain guzzle up to 20% of total energy, since glucose is also used to regulate temperature of the brain in hot weather, less is spared for the process of cognition.

The people who ruled India for almost 200 years, the mighty British have been living on an Island where yearly day temperature is half that of India, 15C vs 31C. UV Radiation is also quite low and so is the scorching sunlight hours. Contrary to popular belief, dark winters don't cause depression. 

[For science]
Okay, these smartypants from the north aren't heatproof. Consider this scenario. If we were to put some of them on an isolated place without education, knowledge and access to any human technology in existence. Only children can be perfect subjects, So thousands of 5 to 12 years old on a big island (or a continent perhaps) in middle of the equator. They'll  explicit the same behavioral tendency of any equatorial human in the first generation itself, angry, lazy and unproductive. They'll procreate, form languages and religions, adapt to hot humid weather, they'll be too busy killing bugs and sheltering from heat, no energy for intellectual reasoning. 500-2000 years have gone by, their IQ has plummeted to new depths. It's now more comparable to Congolese. Several millennia has passed, their skin now exhibits more melanin than ever to protect them from sun. Suddenly one day, A big ship landed on their shore.

""Terra nullius? ^spots ^a ^man  Hello primitive folks! Wassup? Oh god it's so hot in here! Ah! Sunscreen in a jar of honey, you slaves gonna make me money!""
[/don't flame me]

Enough, The rich northern countries are one who are more worried about the climate change, maybe they might invent some artificial clouds or climate alternation tech once it start becoming unbearable there. The way things are moving now, inhabitability of Indo-gangetic plains in my lifetime is evident.

I still dread  the nerve melting summer days. Heat Index of 45C with 55-60 Humidity all July-August.  /imdone",2018-09-02 05:55:15

Short concise interactive books for college students. Indian education system in bad shape.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xldhp/short_concise_interactive_books_for_college/,9,AskIndia,7,9xldhp,1542396558.0,udit003,"I am a computer science college student from India. I found that students always complain about the education system, the poor quality of teachers and teaching methods (and I am one among them, it's awful in India at least) . At the same time some teachers also complain that students don't do any self study at all. They are always looking for shortcuts, like reading an article or some videos here and there to pass the exams .

If we think from the student point of view, it's very difficult for them to read books and get in-depth knowledge for so many subjects every semester at the same time following your passion (which is most of the time , unrelated to the courses they are taking) and taking part in extra curricular activities at college, learning cool technologies to become job ready. Hence it's actually not possible for them to sit down and read through 500 pages books for each subject, do assignments honestly .

I have an idea to solve this problem. If we can develop short (around 100 pages) books for every subject , which are interesting to read and at the same time give students a overall view of the subject to pass the exam. This will help them get a complete picture rather than the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless. Through a collaborative platform online , we can get this book developed by the best people in the community and make it available for everyone to read for free.

This is my idea in very brief, I would love to know your opinions and indulge in further discussion if anyone is interested.",2018-11-17 00:59:18

Currently I am pursuing PhD in information technology. However, my work is progressing toward neuroscience (which I found as my energy converging point). Currently, I am studying emotions. Due to IT background, I am pretty well with the coding skills and applying it for customised high end GPU based calculations on voxel wise activity given some task. Although, I always have this feeling of lack of sufficient knowledge in the field of neuroscience. Although, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible but missing a disciplinary thinking while facing a complex puzzle. Although, I find myself studying about the neuroscience stuff without any sense of exhaustion, a leap step is needed to get deeply indulged in this exciting and important domain.

As it is a transition period for me where I need to use my relatively more developed computational skills to get the sense and pleasure of getting new in-depth knowledge of the field of brain science. I am seeking for the suitable guideline which can give me a better chance to grab the domain knowledge during this transition and lead me towards disciplinary thinking over more complex problems. I am interested in further studying emotions and related disorders. The guidelines during the PhD and after the PhD both are very much needed and highly appreciated. The guidelines can include anything from intern, clinical service, research associate to any junior level fellowship. I just want to learn more about the field.",2019-03-23 19:10:57

We really need to talk about Flairs.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,AskIndia,106,6bacbg,1494883276.0,root_su,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",2017-05-16 02:51:16

The thing is that from the beginning of my college life, I have been depressed. All around me people have been constantly talking about job. I don't want to pursue engineering. I feel trapped and depressed. I spend time sleeping or browsing Internet to distract my mind. Instead of having a goal in my life, I'm always thinking of dying; I'm always thinking of running away. I wanted to study math(and sciences), but due to people telling me to go for the college instead of course(and also because of me not knowing the difference between science and technology), I landed up where I am. And the thing is that now I can't do anything. I'm 23 and living off my parent's money. I don't want to disappoint them. My ability to think rationally has diminished. Now I cannot concentrate for more than a few moments before getting anxious. I think I am depressed but I don't know. I want to die but I cannot. I hate myself to be born. I don't want money or job or anything. I want peace. There is nobody to help me. All people around me think I am an idiot for not thinking rationally. They all want job and money. I want to rest. Either way I'm gonna die, even if I get a job and earn money or not. Should I  run away from the college when the break starts so that nobody knows? I wish I die tonight in my sleep.

""Hello"", I replied. The gentleman joined in, ""Studying in Munich?""
""No. Working"", I said. 
""Where you are from?""
""India"", I said. 
""Oh we are also originally from India. We live in USA. 20 years. Came here to visit our daughter and our grandchildren. We are originally from this city of that state in India"". I smiled and nodded and started speaking to them about that city in that state in India because I also lived there for 7 years. He started saying how much he misses his city and his country, being 20 long years in USA. I smiled and listened although I wanted to return to my book. Here I was sitting surrounded by the statues of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, Leibnitz and hundreds of scientists and mathematicians, the descriptions and depictions of their work in one of the best technical museums of the world containing hundreds of machines of the past, computers, ships, aircrafts, telescopes and what not and suddenly the gentleman said, ""No matter what one says, we are far ahead than them"". I was puzzled. ""What are we talking about?""

The man said, ""In shastra it is written - Everything comes from water and fire. Have you read Veda?"" and then he unfurled a shloka from Veda. I was quite amused. He then continued, ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"". I interjected, ""That I would not know but I think that the contributions of the likes of Ramanujan, Bose, Raman and Chandrasekhar were enormous"". He skirted those names and said, ""I am an engineer. I have to tell you that India is at least 1000 years ahead than any country in science. One has to read Veda"" and then he fired another sloka. His wife was not getting impressed just as I was not making much sense of the sudden outpouring of Sanatan sentiments. 

I realised that it was better to move. But then he did not stop, ""You see it is a matter of what I call perspective. We knew thousands of years back what scientists here are knowing now. Chemistry, atomic physics, space everything we knew. At that time Europe was what? A dark continent. They knew nothing. We invented Zero, you know that?"" 

This is when I lost it. I asked him, ""Sir, you miss your city and your food and friends. That is quite understandable. But I do not understand why you have spent 20 years in USA and your daughter is married in Munich while you miss your country so much and you cannot stop praising it. Why don't you go and live in India? I also do not understand why you are even here when you should be in India digging Vedic spacecrafts.

I am planning a new digital learning initiative. I need your help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8rsrvc/i_am_planning_a_new_digital_learning_initiative_i/,12,AskIndia,22,8rsrvc,1529287273.0,plannercdali,"I have just finished my school education in science in India, and am deeply concerned about the state of affairs. I wish to target specific areas.

Some complain that the system promotes ‘rote memorization’ and that the syllabus is ‘too theoretical’ and is not ‘practical’ or ‘linked with everyday life’.

The system is far worse than that.

In classes 1 to 10:

There is a heavy emphasis on regurgitation of memorised material.

There is too much ‘flab’ in the syllabus.

There is very less rigour in the subjects of maths and science.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to gain a comprehensive picture of a subject, but the line of questioning is such that you don’t need anything more than the textbooks.

There is not much focus given on seeing if students are capable of analysing new information and making pertinent observations.

Further questioning from the students’ side has no real outlet within the traditional syllabus.

In classes 11 and 12:

The rate at which information is to be consumed and understood increases dramatically.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to completely understand a subject BUT understanding is necessary to be able to survive the examinations.

Rote memorisation is an impediment, not an aid to success.

The line of questioning is far from direct. You need stop treating the syllabus as a body to remember, but as a set of tools in your arsenal to fix the problem. You have to generate independent results from the tools you are given.

Every piece of information in the syllabus is important and useful for examinations. There is nothing that you can’t know.

In the world of competitive exams:

You need to go well beyond the given syllabus.

You need to be able to think very creatively and come up with innovative solutions.

Emphasis is given on the ability to manipulate learnt content within extreme time constraints to solve the situation.

You can see the problem, can’t you? For the first 10 years of formal education, when they are in their most neurologically adaptive state, we expect students to have this conformist, regurgitative attitude towards academics, and then, when they are nearly adults, we expect them to have the analytical and creative problem-solving abilities of mini-Einsteins.

There are three categories of students who survive this catastrophe.

The real prodigies. These students quickly learn to move ahead of the existing syllabus and go onward. I respect and admire them.

Those whose circumstances give them a head start. This was me. I hated rote memorisation so I would do the bare minimum necessary. I’m not saying that I performed bad, academically, in classes 1 to 10. It’s just that where the others were busy memorising whole passages verbatim, I was looking at a few key words and facts and building up the rest in the exam hall. That’s the only way I kept a facade up despite a lousy work ethic. Since I was already accustomed to never memorising, it was mainly a matter of adjusting to the new rate and new depth.

Those who can work really, really hard. I admire the sheer determination of this category, and they often overlap with 1. and 2. , but many of them continue with the verbatim approach and clear the struggle by memorising every case and every type of problem possible.

We need to fix this. We need to expose students to a problem-solving based curriculum from day one. We also need to make the syllabus far less top-heavy. With just one or two more chapters in each subject every year, we could have the whole of class 1 to 10 over a couple of years earlier.

In the traditional system, I would have said that this is impossible. It needs a curriculum change, reskilling of teachers, change of public policy, bulldozing public opinion that school is becoming ‘harder’, and forcing experimental teaching and evaluation methods on schoolchildren.

In the digital world, creating an adaptive learning system for such a goal is a far less difficult challenge.

In my ‘ideal-scenario’ curriculum, I would focus on only four skills:

Critical reading: In the current scenario, learning the ‘chapters’ is given more emphasis than on checking if students can actually process new passages of information. Most students are unable to self-learn and are dependent on spoonfeeding for this reason.

Critical writing and grammar: I don’t mean the typical ‘parts-of-speech-in-detail’ grammar. I just mean being able to differentiate between correct and incorrect English grammar and being able to apply it to express new ideas. Once students can do this, they no longer have to memorise passages to answer in exams — they can construct their own sentences.

Arithmetic and geometry: Pretty self explanatory.

Logical reasoning: This is not subject-specific. It should be done in a way which is independent of any particular technical subject. In the JEE, the content is based on PCM, but they actually test us on our critical thinking and logical reasoning ability — using the subject as a medium. We don’t have to use any prerequisite subject.

I need the help of subject curriculum and testing experts, web designers, teachers, students, and anybody else who feels that they can contribute to this project.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you saw my above post, then you know what this is about.

I really, really need help from experts in both education (in both STEM and liberal arts) and technology implementation (primarily web design, UX/UI etc.)

Otherwise, I guess it is up to only me to revise 12 years of syllabus for a broken system, rewrite and execute lecture videos, come up with suitable assessments, code the adaptive assessment system, build the website, and deploy it.

All of that, assuming I already know how to do it, would take at least a year for one person to execute -- that's assuming they are working full time.

Which I can't.

And that's if I knew how to do everything by myself.

Which I don't.

What this means is that without help, this project in it's current form will be over before it even got started.

Even if you can't join the core dev team, it would be a huge step forward if you could direct me somehow to find the support I need for this project.

Thanks,

While police firing led to death of one protestor there are conflicting reports on whether the woman killed was part of protesters or was she looking at the events from her verandah and was hit by a stray bullet.

>The people were protesting against killing of a militant in an encounter with police and army.
Officials said that police and army cordoned the Kharpora area of Kakapora this afternoon. “Some militants who were walking in a street fired towards the forces which were retaliated, triggering an encounter,” officials said.
“The encounter continued for two hours in which one militant was killed. However three others managed to escape from the spot,” they said.
The killed militant was identified as Adil Ahmad of Banderpora, Pulwama.
“As the encounter was on, hundreds of people from neighbouring villages staged massive protests and pelted stones on the forces in order to help the militants break the cordon,” officials said. The forces fired tear smoke shells and bullets on the protesters, killing a local boy on the spot. He was identified as Danish Farooq Mir son of Farooq Ahmad, resident of RatniporaPulwama. Danish was a student of B Tech in Islamic University of Science and Technology.

His nationality is Canada/US. He was born and brought up there but also visited India on holidays.

Like many other mathematicians he has compared poetry and music to mathematics. He has studied Sanskrit poetry at college level. Here is a quote from him

> ""As a child, I enjoyed studying Sanskrit, Sanskrit poetry and Indian classical music. I saw maths in all these things; that further inspired me to pursue mathematics. When I went to college, I took Sanskrit, a lot of music, computer science and physics, and also mathematics. To me, mathematics was the common thread in all these subjects""

As a lover of Sanskrit language, I know the distance between the statements “Panini’s grammar precedes any formal grammar by two millennia” and “Sanskrit is compulsory to get a job at NASA”. Then there is a rainbow of truths and falsehoods between them.

Here is an excerpt where our Education Minister (then) explains how Bhargava teaches math at princeton (at 1m30s):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GGkIiZou5I&t=1m30s

> In Princeton, in his class — which is the most famous — is “Mathematics for Non-Mathematicians”. I have had the privilege of having talks with Manjul on many occasions and I know him well. And I asked him — what excites you most about teaching that class. **He said, I teach that class in Sanskrit and poetry from India**, and poetry that my mother got from her house in Jaipur. Now imagine Manjul trying to do the same in India …

Aside: the victimhood continues. She can’t imagine a math/cs professor talking about Panini when teaching BNF etc in an IIT. Imagine!

But more importantly, she is outrightly spreading falsehoods about Bhargava. I have followed his work and also his media appearances for some time. He is very mindful of what he speaks. He can never say something as stupid as “I teach my math class in Sanskrit”.

What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

This will be long, so please bear with me. 


Many months back, I came across this [interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/aatish-taseer-india-is-semi-literate-and-chetan-bhagat-is-the-best-it-can-do/20150205.htm) with Aatish Taseer, where he calls India a ""semi-literate"" country. I was quite baffled then, by his words. Why would someone with such deep connections to India make such a disparaging comment on its citizens? Its true significance has finally hit me and it's making me sad.

We're a country of a billion people with few opportunities and deep contrasts. However instead of trying to bridge the divide, mend the fracture and soothe the pain, we keep insisting on magnifying the gap and adding salt to the wounds. 

How did we become so politically incorrect as a nation? How did we let bigotry define us to such a large extent? How did we let education fail us?

As Indians, our single goal as kids has been reduced to clearing entrance exams without realising the kind of studies that we're getting involved in, to get there. We're not broadening our minds to ideas, we're not enhancing our understanding of ourselves, we're not experimenting with out of the box ideas on science and technology. No. As 15-16 year old kids, we're solving questions. Recognising patterns. Trying to understand the examiner's psyche in order to get the most questions correct, sometimes spending months and even years in those hallowed halls they call coaching institutes. If you manage to set aside all the hoopla around coaching institutions, they're merely *cram schools*. Even our neighbouring China has them. But we as kids, and more importantly our parents, don't want to be told of that. Because deep down, that term *cram school* conflicts with our idea of what education should be all about. I, like many millions, was also a victim of this. Yes, I made it though. But I'm under no illusion about exactly what I've achieved. I've crammed and smarted my way through entrance exams by recognising patterns and understanding ""important concepts"" without ever learning to think for myself.

And then the results are in front of us to see. This [video](https://youtu.be/Rfw5nQy5_pw) popped up on the front page of my YouTube yesterday and I ended up watching it. One of the kids here appears to be incredibly cocky about what he thinks of people who weren't able to qualify for IIT. I don't blame the guy, maybe a few years back I'd have behaved the same way. But he exposes how limited our understanding is, of education. Our entrance exams, be it medical or engineering, are tough *because* we have such a huge population. That and because the number of institutions of repute (even though the IITs don't even rank among the very best institutes in the world) in this country is embarrassingly minuscule. 

College education is a similar tragedy. Teachers merely teach. Students merely attend classes. Teachers get promoted after a few years, students graduate every year. The teachers have no incentive to teach, they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students, they don't get recognition for using exemplary methods of teaching. And yet they expect students to do well, grasp concepts and become contributors to the society, magically. Our respect for teachers in this country runs deep. Unfortunately, that blinds us to the gross callousness with which most of them do their *jobs*. As a result, we graduate not as informed educated citizens, capable of engaging with a wide range of people on a variety of topics, but as robots. Robots capable of working efficiently, without having the ability to position us in the grand scheme of things, without having the ability to question and without having a worldview. 

But enough about institutional education. What about how we think? Do we even know *how* to think? Are we tolerant enough and respectful enough to differences of opinion? Are we accommodative enough? Do we know our history? Do we know who we are as a country? 

In the comments section of the same video I shared, you'll see many plainly abusive comments about SC STs made without realising how bigoted they sound. The hatred for the lower castes is clear. The hatred, often, isn't even about reservations. It's about a group of people who we think don't deserve to be where they are, or more specifically, where they are being allowed to go. How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do we have to be, to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

The tragedy is not that we are bigots. The tragedy is how we *fail to recognise* how bigoted we are. The tragedy is not that we are inherently casteist as a society. The tragedy is that we constantly *fail to recognise* how casteist we are as a society. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ1EgsRT1zk), an interview by Ravish Kumar of an African student, exposes just how limited our understanding is of race. He is referred to as a ""gorilla"" in nowhere else but the capital city of the country. How can we as a nation, as a colonised nation in the past, not empathise with Africans? How can we be racist to a group of people who were treated the same way as we were by colonial powers of the day? In other words, how deeply has our education system failed us, that we have lost the ability to recognise our shared history?

If you go through comments on Twitter (and no I don't mean just the hateful comments directed towards a particular group of people), you'll realise how incredibly easy we find ourselves to be insensitive, even when we're not hiding under the hood of anonymity. An Indian woman, from a religious minority, was rescued by the government from a foreign country, in an astonishing attempt that brought out in me a deep sense of respect for government officers and diplomats. And then I read disparaging comments about her family on Twitter on the same day, by religious nut jobs. Add to that the hegemony, a certain group of people hold in our society, and the whole thing becomes scary. 

Bigotry and hatred, borne out of ignorance and pure cluelessness, have become a disease. And I will not even mention Facebook here because that is a cesspool of hideous ideas. Even some of my friends and colleagues, who I've known for a long time, have in many cases become absolute hypocrites, espousing hatred towards the disadvantaged and more importantly, towards the *different*. It's not about conflicting ideas of conservatism and liberalism. Its not even about the right and the left. It's about basic decency and having a semblance of understanding about our position as Indians in the world.

I do not excuse myself of this prejudice, of course. Having become a product of this system, I've also become a victim of the same kind of regressive thought processes that haunt many. May we all strive to, at least, *recognise* this, and if possible, mend our ways. 

We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers. And most importantly, this country deserves better citizens.

"How an ambulance rushed through 500+ kilometers of narrow roads in Kerala in 6 hours to transport a critically sick baby - A true story of unity, determination, and togetherness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dkd0z/how_an_ambulance_rushed_through_500_kilometers_of/,15,AskIndia,125,7dkd0z,1510947910.0,fsko,"I had written this as a late comment on [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7decjh/np_this_is_thameem_the_ambulance_driver_who_drove/) which blew up to get 1000+ upvotes. Someone suggested me to write it as a post to get better visibility. So, here is it.

The baby was sick in a pretty good hospital, but possibly had some serious heart issue, and one of the best specialized cardiac hospital in the country is this hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. They have researched and developed even their own prosthetic heart. 

The hospital where the baby was taken to is a super specialized hospital made exclusively to research and treat the heart disease of kids. It's name itself is Pediatric Cardiology Medical College due to its specialty. They only take extreme referral cases like this one. 

This hospital was founded before the independence by Maharaja of Travancore because his son, crown prince Sree Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma had an untreatable heart disease since his birth which led to his death at the age of six and the Maharaja wanted no one to suffer the same fate, hence such a super specialized hospital to research such diseases was created in his memory with the name Sree Avittom Thirunal(SAT) Hospital at a time period when even normal hospitals were rare in India.

Later, another bigger hospital was also started by the last Maharaja next to this hospital with more departments called Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum. And, this hospital was pioneers of various things in the field of cardiac medical science in the world. The baby was taken to this hospital.

This was the reason why the baby had to be transported there instead of any other hospital in the country. It was just the best option for the survival of the baby.

**Air ambulance** was ruled out because of the critical condition of the baby who had much better chances with a land-based ambulance.

Kerala has a good road network, but the roads are narrow due to the population density of the state. At many places, it is just one lane in both directions. Any traffic can delay by a lot. The normal journey in this route will take over 14 hours, yet this ambulance reached in less than half of that time - 6hours 40mins.

This was done due to the help of some volunteers across the state. A GPS device was attached to the ambulance and the location was transmitted to everyone. There were WhatsApp groups with people around the state.

When the ambulance is near any of the volunteer's location, they will remove the traffic of that location so that the ambulance can pass without any traffic. This was how they were able to travel at such speeds through so many towns. During the entire journey, they only had to slow down once at Alapuzha. Other than that, everything went smooth. There are lot of [videos on social media](https://twitter.com/Advaidism/status/931063525493022720) of people controlling traffic at various parts of the state

Along with volunteers, police also helped. Police vehicles escorted the ambulance during the entire journey and traffic police of each district made the arrangements to make the roads as clear as possible. It helped the Ambulance maintain 100 to 120kmph speed.

This story is not just about the ambulance driver. It is not just about the driver who drove the police escort vehicles in front of the ambulance. It is not about any single individual. Instead, it is about what we can achieve if a lot of people come together as one force. It is about togetherness. It is about unity. This story is awesome because so many people came together that day to make this happen.

Few such incidents have happened in the past too. A Malayalam movie named Traffic (2011) was made loosely based on a real incident similar to this. It is an excellent movie worth watching.  Traffic movie was remade into Tamil as Chennaiyil Oru Naal, in Kannada as Crazy Star and is also remade in Hindi, with the same name Traffic (2016). The best one is, of course, the original movie.  Watch the original movie if you can, as it is a unique movie which is shot from the perspective of a dozen people in a way no Indian movie has done before.

Since most people are not reading the draft policy and trying to turn this post into how the GoI controls premier education and how bad the condition is. Look it's not that we aren't aware of it, we all know the reality but I hoped that this post will be about solutions, not cribbing about problems. Anyway here is the gist of drafted policy:

**Objective:**

To provide an **enabling regulatory architecture** to **ten public and ten private** Higher Educational Institutions to emerge as world-class Teaching and Research Institutions. (Right now we have way too many policy restriction on universities, they need approval for almost everything from UGC).

**What the hell do they mean by enabling regulatory architecture :**

These draft Guidelines & Regulations contain eligibility criteria, selection procedure, other Regulatory aspects, monitoring & evaluation, etc for World Class Institutions. These have been drafted considering the characteristics of a institutions which are world class which includes exceptionally high quality teaching and research standards preferably in multi-disciplinary areas; a significant proportion of international and meritorious students; a reasonably good proportion of qualified faculty from high-ranked universities worldwide, transparent and need-blind system to ensure intake of meritorious students; adequate financial assistance to students; a healthy faculty student ratio; well-equipped facilities for teaching, research, administration and student-life; adequate infrastructure for operations and expansion; autonomous governance structures; financial soundness through either a large corpus fund or recourse to public funding, as the case may be and, teaching and research collaborations with reputed global universities. 

The draft Guidelines & Regulations also provides for admission procedure, fixing appropriate fee structures pursuant to internal policies, appointment of faculty, collaboration with foreign higher educational institutions, and design and offer courses in existing programmes and new areas. **Additionally, these institutions shall have complete financial autonomy to spend the resources raised and allocated.**

**Expectation from World class institution:**

1.	It should preferably be multi-disciplinary and have both teaching and research focus of an exceptionally high quality. Apart from the regular courses, it should also offer various inter-disciplinary courses, including in areas of emerging technology and interest as well as those of relevance to the development concerns of countries like India. 

2.	It should have a good proportion of foreign or foreign qualified faculty. There should be a reasonably good mix of domestic and foreign students. There should be a transparent merit based selection in admissions, so that the focus remains on getting meritorious students.                          


3.	There should be laboratory facilities that do cutting-edge scientific research for those Institutions engaged in scientific research. In case of humanities and social science and other interdisciplinary areas, the faculty should be engaged in research and field work in frontier areas using the latest methodologies. 

4.	It should have student amenities comparable with that of globally reputed institutions. It should have a student enrolment of at least twenty thousand students in a period of fifteen years. The faculty student ratio should not be less than 1:10 after three years of declaration as a World Class Institution. 

5.	It should come in top five hundred of any of the world renowned ranking frameworks (such as the Times Higher Education World University Rankings or QS or Shanghai’s Jiao Tong University) in the first ten years of setting up or being declared as World Class Institution. 

**Financial assistance to WCI:**

The assistance would be up to an amount of Rupees five hundred Crore to each Institution in a span of five years from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The annual release would be dependent on the institution achieving the financial and physical outcomes laid down in its implementation plan. However, if any Institution shows capacity to absorb the funds earlier and is able to give the expected outcomes, an accelerated pace of funding would also be allowed. The funding under these guidelines would be in addition to the existing funding to which they are entitled to.

[Link](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/meteorological-predictions-are-not-perfect-we-never-claim-that-it-is-a-science-we-do-our-best-d-sivananda-pai-imd/) 


**On unreliable forecasts from IMD**
>- I admit that meteorological predictions are not perfect. We never claim that we are 100 per cent right. It is a science and we do the best we can. 
- Rainfall is never equally distributed throughout the city. So, generally, forecasting the exact rainfall value over a particular location is not possible. For eg. in case of recent rains in Mumbai, the regional variation was so high that within the city itself, Dharavi recorded 56 cm of rainfall, Santacruz 33 cm and Colaba about 10 cm 
- Nature is not deterministic. It is a chaotic system. A high degree of randomness prevails and even the best of models cannot eliminate this uncertainty.
- Nature does not behave in the same manner every time, there will still be some discrepancy between the model result and actual event. We need to be aware of 
 these inherent limitations.


**On comparison with more accurate forecasts in other countries**
>- I would say it is only partially correct. We give very accurate forecasts for cyclones. Other countries have more accurate forecasts over short-range, day-to-day variation, because of radar coverage and lesser uncertainties in weather systems. However, our extended range and seasonal forecasts are much better than them.
- There is a difference in weather events in other countries and India. England lies in an extra-tropical region. Their weather is dictated by frontal systems which are much more stable and predictable. India, on the other hand, is in the tropical belt. There is more randomness in weather events.
- In the US or Europe, their entire area is tracked by radars. It gives them better short-range forecasts. We don’t have radars that  continuously monitor every region because it wasn’t considered very cost-effective. We need 30-40 more Doppler Radars. We are in the process of getting them. Once we have more radars, our short-range forecasts will also improve. But our cyclone forecast is one of the best in the world. 


**On the availability of best technology**
>- We now have a very good computer system, which will be further upgraded this December. We have very good weather models. Many of our IMD officials are in charge of technical committees at the WMO. I am myself chairing a technical team at the WMO which provides regional climate outlook. If you are not the best, you would not be picked up for these jobs. 
- India is, and now it is globally acknowledged, at the same level as developed countries in weather forecasting.
- There are many other issues that apply to meteorology in general like our data-collecting capability over oceans is not very good. Even on land, it is difficult to get data from certain areas such as Afghanistan


**IMD on world front**
>- People in the WMO take India as the natural leader in meteorology in this part of the world. Our scientists are very well respected.
- India, being the natural leader, was asked not just to prepare forecasts for South Asia but also to train other countries in the region.

"Hi, /r/India! TRAI wants to know how we can hold telecom operators accountable for mobile data speeds. Here's how you can make your voice heard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6esgm8/hi_rindia_trai_wants_to_know_how_we_can_hold/,11,AskIndia,215,6esgm8,1496409982.0,shadowbannedguy1,"Firstly, here is the consultation paper: [Consultation Paper on Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband Plans](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf) [PDF]

###**What is this?**

TRAI wants to know **how mobile Internet providers should be held more accountable for the data speeds they advertise.** Mobile data speeds are much more variable and unpredictable than fixed-line broadband connections, so TRAI is looking at whether they should make a 'label' from telcos mandatory that specifies what kind of speeds customers should expect from their connections. TRAI also wants to know what kind of tech they can use to *measure* how fast telcos' connections actually are for their subscribers.

###**Sounds great! How do I send in my ideas?**

First of all, take a deep breath. Telcos are going to have a really long answer to this consultation, and their lobbying will be polished and elaborate -- they do **not want to be regulated.** If you are a concerned citizen, you need to make your voice *heard*, not just *counted.*

Telecom consultation filings are not rocket science. You can send in a good and insightful response, and it won't take you more than an hour or two. Remember, your response **will be read**, and this TRAI administration leans towards consumers. 

**Read the consultation paper.** [Here's the link again](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf). Read it fully, it's only 30 pages long, and gives you enough context and information to be able to answer the questions.

**Draft a response.** This should not take you very long. You have a month to send a response in, so just spend a couple days collating all the points you want to mention in your response, order them under subheads, and work them into your answers to each question.

Make a PDF or Word Document of your response and email it to **kapilhanda@trai.gov.in**.

###**Cool! What's the deadline?**

The deadline is **29th June**. You can email TRAI and ask them to extend this deadline if you feel that this time is not adequate, and they usually do extend deadlines upon request. But try and get in on this right as telcos do, because TRAI may read responses as and when they ge them.

The deadline for **counter-comments**, which is an ***equally important stage***, if not more, where you have to counter arguments made by other responders, is **13th July**. 

###**What are the questions?**

Here are the questions TRAI wants you to answer. (emphasis all mine; text slightly edited for clarity). If you feel like you don't know the context for some of these questions, check the consultation paper; it will probably answer any questions you might have about the existing regulatory framework that telcos face.

Q1: Is the information on wireless broadband [mobile internet] speeds currently available to consumers *transparent enough* to help them make informed choices?

Q2: If it is difficult [for telcos] to commit to a minimum download speed, then could an
average speed be specified by service providers? What should
be the parameters for calculating this average speed?

Q3: What changes can be brought about to the *existing framework* on
wireless broadband tariff plans to encourage better transparency
and comparison between plans offered by different service
providers?

Q4: Is there a need to *include or delete* any of the *QoS parameters*
and/or revise any of the benchmarks currently stipulated in the
Regulations?

Q5: Should disclosure of *average network performance* over a period
of time or at peak times including through broadband facts/labels
be made *mandatory*?

Q6: Should standard application/websites be identified for mandating
comparable disclosures about network speeds?

Q7: What are the products/technologies that can be used to measure
actual end-user experience on mobile broadband networks? At
what level should the measurements take place (e.g., on the 
device, network node)?

Q8: *Are there any legal, security, privacy or data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data?*

a) If so, how can these issues be addressed?  
b) Do these issues create a challenge for the adoption of any
measurement tools?

Q9: What measures can be taken to *increase awareness among
consumers* about wireless broadband speeds, availability of
various technological tools to monitor them and any potential
concerns that may arise in the process?

I will add more. If People provide explanation that why we shouldn't read them, that will be better. 
It is not necessary that sources should belong to India. We can also discuss about BBC, the diplomat, IDSA, Washington post, huffington post, guardian and other internet resources (I am not implying that they are bad but we should discuss them)

I will add more. 

Some users pointed that there is no good journalism. But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful.

My college is mediocre and moreover my CGPA is a bit on the lower side, thus I might not be able to sit in campus placements of many companies. But to compensate for it I have many small and big projects in my portfolio on technologies like android, web development, python, django, basic ML, reactjs and ethereum blockchain. I have learned these things on my own through internet. I am OKish but not that good in DS/algo. I might not get a campus placement due to low cgpa and also due to not being good in DS/algo. I am passionate about programming and I want to work in decent companies/ startups where I can further improve my stack. How to find such jobs? What should be my strategy? I am currently in 7th semester, should I start searching immediately? Do most off campus companies require immediate joining (I still have a year to get my degree finished)? It would be great if anyone with a similar experience could share their insights.",2018-08-13 06:31:20
