I am an in-the-closet exmuslim who's deeply sympathetic to Muslims in India as they are my friends and family. I am also extremely critical of Islam as an organized religion because it ruined my life and the life of others like myself.  


We have a fledgling subreddit, r/IndianExmuslims for others like us. We are not anti-Muslim, we just don't believe Islam's claims and feel Islam should be criticized like any other belief system.

We will be hosting Srinivas Kodali in an AMA today 6 PM. He is an independent researcher who has been documenting the Aadhaar project along with several other researchers. His work made him file public interest litigation against the illegal voter deletions by ECI using Aadhaar and NPR data.

On our request, he sent us the following text explaining the significance of NPR.

> The national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan. The project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when India realised it can't identify the foreigners from indians. During a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001, the project was approved. Part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed Multi Purpose National Identity Cards, which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip. While this project was being piloted, India went through another attack on 26/11/08 in Mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen.  This is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on. 

> But post 26/11, due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like NATGRID, CCTNS, CMS, Aadhaar poppped up. Aadhaar project and NPR were very similar. So to deal with it, the cabinet combined both of them, the registar general of india became a registrar under UIDAI and started distributing Aadhaar. The deal was NPR will get biometrics from UIDAI post de-duplication, but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyone. 

> After all of this, NPR project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015. The project in itself is the start of National Register of Citizens. NPR data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residents.

His Twitter: https://twitter.com/digitaldutta

Recently he published an article on NRC-NPR-Aadhaar nexus on thewire.in. Please feel free to go through it ~ [Digital India on Steroids: How Aadhaar Infra Enables the NPR and the NRC.

"AMA Announcement: Aatish Taseer, writer, journalist. December 27th, 9:30 PM IST (i.e. today!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eg6zrz/ama_announcement_aatish_taseer_writer_journalist/,24,AMA,159,eg6zrz,1577453565.0,anonymouse_2001,"Hello r/India,

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

The AMA is scheduled for 27th December, 9:30 PM IST. 

Please be there!

As a Singaporean of Indian heritage, I’ve come across a growing number of Indian nationals in Singapore – both visitors and expatriates – as well as Indian nationals on various trips around Southeast Asia. Many of them are cognisant of the fact that there is a localised ethnic Indian community in the Malay archipelago (Malaysia and Singapore, and to a lesser extent Indonesia) – but they know little about the intricate details, like our history, our distinct Anglophone culture and distinct religious traditions, the way we've been nativised to this part of the world for centuries and have become a distinctive ethnic group in our own right, and how this makes our contemporary populace differ from the prominent Indian diasporic groups that emigrated to the West largely after India's independence from the British Empire (Indian-Americans, Indo-Canadians, British Indians).

I’d like to use this AMA as an opportunity to foster a greater understanding of Singaporean (and by extension, Malaysian) Indians on r/India. Feel free to ask me anything that relates to our history, our settlement patterns and the circumstances that drove them, our ethnolinguistic profile, our culture, religion, sense of self-identity and conception of nationhood, our perceptions of India, our place in Singapore and our ties with the Malays and Chinese, and really anything along these lines!

McDonlad’s franchines began popping up in Bombay around the mid 2000s. One opened near where I lived at the time. I was an engineering student at a decent Bombay college and before the semester exams, I’d be studying at home. My mom would force me to mop the floors and do the dishes. Youth makes most rebel against order and I did too. I told my mom that I’d rather mop the floors at the nearby McDonald’s branch and be paid rather than do the same work at home for no pay. She reluctantly let me try my luck but didn’t have high hopes.

I proved her wrong and was quite smug about it. All I did was to walk into the store a week after it opened, ask for the manager and explained that I was looking for a job. He sat me down, explained the terms and did the expected song and dance. I left my phone number with him and lo and behold, he called the next morning asking when I could begin. I began the following morning.

My tasks consisted of doing anything at the store with two exceptions: I could not operate the fryer as you first had to pass a course and I could not do deliveries as I did not have a two-wheeler license. Anything else was fair game and I manned the counter, served customers, cleaned toilets, manned the take-out counter and yes, mopped the floor.

My hours were 9 AM – 7 PM and the store opened at 10 AM. The first hour was spent preparing the store for the onslaught of the McDonald’s-craving indian junta many of whom were sinister vegetarians. I say sinister because if these people had their way, they would crucify anyone who ate meat. Since they could not do this, they resorted to making a nuisance of themselves everywhere they went. At home, they thought nothing of abusing the labour of a lower-caste servant and would force said servant to eat and drink from separate utensils. Anything that came into contact with a meat-eater was deemed to have been defiled and must be purified by magic incantations and ritual cleansing with water. These same people once called the police because my family was cooking fish. The irony of eating food at a restaurant that also served chicken was lost on them but that’s partly because they love the gora and anything that the gora sells to them.

Anyhow, once the doors opened at 10 AM, the first wave of customers was invariably college students. Decent people but fairly docile. They viewed McDonald’s servings as the quail and manna of the gods and would rarely complain if the food was substandard which it often was. The evening mom crowd, though, was another story.

#Half information is a dangerous thing

One Friday evening, I was at the counter when a well-fed gujurati lady walked up with her well-fed son. They ordered a happy meal for the young meatball and a veggie burger and a coke for madam. There is an internet rumour that chains like McDonalds cheat customers on Coca-Cola by including too much ice. This is not entirely true. The reality is that the syrup coming out of the machine is not entirely diluted and the ice is there for two reasons: to keep the drink cold and to add water. The woman was not aware of this and I served her drink with the standard half-cup of ice. She walked away, found a table and took offence almost immediately. To set the scene, lines when McDonalds first opened in the Bombay suburbs were fairly long and they only kept growing through the day. This woman cuts to the front of the line and accuses me of cheating her with the coke. I said that it was standard practice and even offered to replace her drink with another one. She agreed but kept shouting that I was a cheater. Ok.

I filled a new cup with the coke syrup from the machine and proceeded to add cold water from the fridge. She started screaming at this point and demanded that I fill the cup with the syrup. I acquiesced. She walked away with a cup of sugary coke syrup. One customer later, she was back and again shouted at me and accused me of cheating. I said that I had done exactly as she has asked to which she replied “is that how you talk to your mother” and flung the contents of the cup at my face.

Indians have this disgusting and mistaken belief that if they pay for a service, they own the service staff. Anecdotally, this seems to be prevalent among the upper castes. The manager appeared on the scene because of the commission and sided with the woman. In india, the word of a woman is taken as gospel and the man is automatically the target of the ire of a lynch mob. I was lucky that no violence was involved. At the end of this scene, the front half of my body was a sticky, sugary mess and the woman walked away with a 1000 rupee voucher.

#Beggars

McDonalds have a “food slide” between the kitchen and the counters which is essentially an inclined, stainless steel chute with multiple lanes for food. Once placed, anything on the slide must be on a customer’s place within 90 seconds or it would be binned. Perfectly good food would be binned because it was getting cold. I decided to do a good deed and found a clean bag into which I deposited food from the slide. Good burgers, plenty of fries and a smattering of other “food”. Once done for the day, I took this bag outside and began handing its contents out to the beggars on the street. I was soon mobbed by several but had enough food to go around. They seemed grateful but I did not know what was in store.

The next morning, as soon as the shutters were raised, within literally seconds, about 100 beggars began banging on the glass window panes demanding food. The manager was called and Ashutosh was not pleased when it was revealed that I the naive was the culprit. I still gathered the food but I took it to the local church and left it to them to distribute it.

#Space hogs

Although it has chairs and tables, McDonalds is a sit-down restaurant in the same way that Bombay is a world class city. This, however, would not deter our local business men (read thugs and politicians) from trying to hold business meetings in the restaurant. One fine evening during the rush hour, we had a local politician from the Congress show up, demand food and to the surprise of everyone there, actually pay for it. He then took his entourage and demanded that seated customers pay obeisance to him by vacating their tables. This being India, they complied and the man proceeded to have a 4 hour and 26 minute meeting there with a party of 24 people. I know because we kept notes. He paid for a big mac and a portion of fries.

#Midnight in Gujarat

Anyone who’s lived near Gujjus will know that many, many gujjus who run their own business have a tendency to eat dinner at 10 PM. McDonalds closed at 10 PM according to the signs but 21:54 was when a torrent of pot-bellied gujju uncles with their puffed-poori wives and kids would line up outside the take-away counter. Although the seating area was off-limits and the front door was closed, Ashutosh would not say no to paying customers. To these gujjus, the sliced buns of McDonald’s bread was like the parted waters of the red sea and I was their Moses. I was often stunned at how much these people ate. I’m a skinny person and I could not eat more than two large McDonald’s burgers. I once saw a man eat 4. In 5 minutes. I worry for his arteries and his wife’s hips.

#Marathi Manoos and the Sena

Fish was once served at our restaurant though it was soon taken off the menu after a group of angry nativists protested. They showed up with the constabulary and orange flags, some with snarling tigers on them and demanded that we stop selling fish, which is apparently haram in staunch Maharashtrian circles. Ashutosh caved and the offending Piscean meat was removed. Another time, the cops showed up with booze and demanded food. They did not pay but sat on the seats, drank and laughed like louts. In the land of the poor, the police are the mafia.

In all, my experience with McDonalds was decent. I worked three months including most of my vacation. I worked 12 hours most days and was paid 350 rupees for each day’s work with no overtime. I worked 6 days a week but the restaurant was open all 7 days, 9 AM – 11 PM for staff (customer hours were shorter). I had the distinct advantage of getting in early when the chain was new and had few employees. I also had the advantage of speaking fairly decent English at a time when most employees did not. If you’re considering this as an option to make some money, things may have changed more recently. I would not recommend eating McDonald’s food regularly. Even the church where I would deposit unused food asked that I stop brining any over. They did not like it because it was oily and would not spoil, the latter causing much suspicion about the contents of the food.

These were my stories from my time there. I have several more, if anyone’s interested. Feel free to AMA about my experiences and thanks for reading."

It makes me think about private employees of Non IT sector. Their work can't be done from home and not every company is generous enough to pay employees this whole time (as long as this stays). How are they going to deal with this whole thing? 

There's so many other sections of the society to think about too - indian students studying abroad, bachelors who work away from home, and many more.

Edit 2: After contact with the mods, they have said that there is no manner this post can be verified. Well, very well. I will close the AMA tomorrow noon, please ask anything you'd like, I don't mind answering it as long as it is not very personal. I did offer to show the mods my nudes to verify though 😁

I did an AMA here a while ago. You can [read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/hi_india_im_a_pakistani_ama/)

It was honestly one of the most moving experiences of my life. People started off slightly aggressive, with downvotes and sarcasm, but by the end we were all laughing about saalans in icecream dabbas, ""Sharma jee ka beta"" mentality, newspaper liners in drawers, and swapping music and movies.

I'm so sad about the tragedies going on at our borders right now. To me, an Indian life lost is as big a travesty as a Pakistani life lost, and I know my Pakistani friends feel the same.

Hamari zubaan ek hai, rang ek hai, libas ek hai, aur ham ek waqt par ek hee hotay thay. Just because you say dibba and I say dabba doesn't mean we can't get along.

I just wanted to ask my Indian dost how you guys feel about what's happening, and wondering if there's anything the people - you and I - can do to make things better?

**This is a time for dialogue and friendship and acceptance. Let's not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what we've been trying to create.**

Please talk to me, and tell me your points of view.

Love you guys!

Dhanyawaad!"

Keeping up /u/pollguard legacy and /r/India tradition. I present to you Mark My Word Thread of 2019.

**Happy Diwali Guys**

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

Last years thread-https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9uxnic/diwali_2018_mark_my_word_thread_and_link_to/

Thank you so much for making this AMA so much fun! I learned so much about India and I can relate to you all so much! I wish we could all get along better. We are literal kin, far back and deep down. I would love to come to India some day and meet people as lovely and hilarious and curious as you lot! And I'd love it if you guys came down to my country, too!

Finally, I'll leave you all with a quote from A Song of Ice and Fire which reminds me about the partition, and what a tragedy it was, and how we can all strive to do better, and love each other as the brothers and sisters we really are:

>“It all goes back and back,"" Tyrion thought, ""to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.”

Let's not be puppets. Let's love and share and break the cycle that has been handed down to us.

Dont know how much time is left, as I have completely lost it - faith, believe system and hope and most importantly my comprehension ability.

Some background info: The summer of 2009, me and my best friend discovered that if we dressed sharp and smelled right, nobody would bother asking us if we belong at a wedding.

I had a Luna back then and we would drive around a popular area here in Hyderabad with a large number of function halls and visit each one until we couldn't eat anymore.

Our folks have finally met, and contrary to the usual drama one would expect, everything went well and our families are genuinely happy for us. We tie the knot by year end. 
 
Her father's English is fine, but her mother really doesn't speak the language (appreciate the effort though) - mostly unintelligible. Still, I translated where needed and filled in the blanks.

All the while waifu-to-be was a wee bit nervous with the whole interaction scene, but it turned out to be a lovely evening. They've traveled a long way and I was joking how the roles have reversed in contrast with traditional Indian norms where the prospect groom is expected to visit the bride and her family.
 
Mom had seen her photos on my Facebook, but was overly impressed with her skin and hair in person, to the point I had to ask her to tone it down a bit with the awkward complements. My dad and her dad got into conversations around food and a bunch of other stuff. 
 
I guess I'm writing this because it's a bit surreal how smooth everything has been. Her folks had zero issues with their daughter dating a gaijin, maybe because they knew where I worked, and my folks are just happy I didn't turn out to be gay (they had suspected so for a while on extremely silly grounds). Had it been an Indian partner, I don't think it would have been this straightforward.

Anyway, I'm tired and will crash, but feel free to ask me anything about Japan, work and life there, partners and dating etc.

Greetings [/r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)!

Tomorrow, August 24, marks the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on the Right to Privacy judgement. This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.

If you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. If you use duckduckgo, show up. If you didn't link your Aadhaar to anything, show up. If you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

Collectively, we are the #SaveOurPrivacy drafting volunteers. Our twitter handles are below.

"AMA : I orchestrated a protest against an impossible force(corrupt businessmen,media, politicians & police) for justice in India and won. It changed the system in an entire state. This post is meant to be a guide for whistleblowers on ""How to run a successful campaign in India as an ordinary person""",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gziej/ama_i_orchestrated_a_protest_against_an/,79,AMA,553,8gziej,1525471683.0,HelpSaveStudents,"Last year, I had made a [post on this very subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) asking your help to fight against injustice. I was a desperate person at that time and didn't think that there is any chance that it will be successful. After writing that post, I unknowingly became the mastermind behind a protest against corrupt college administrators, corrupt police officers and the media which would refuse to listen to us because they were getting money from these corrupt people.

This incident involves the torture and the death of a student caused by the college management, bribing the police and media to keep quiet, several months of protests which bloomed into a state-wide-unrest forcing the politicians to change sides, arrest & imprisonment of the absconding chairman of a college, vice principal, owners etc and finally the reform of the education system of an entire state! And, I was the one who orchestrated the protest which resulted in all of this. I spent every conscious hour of two months of my life working behind this campaign.

I dont want to repeat the entire incident, so you can read about the incident in detail in it's well written [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_College_of_Engineering_and_Research_Centre). Make sure to read about the student death controversy and then the police report which is below under different subsection. Also you can go through my old posts in this subreddit like [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) and [this photo](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5niiw4/this_is_not_saudi_arabia_they_are_not_muslims/)

I am making this AskMeAnything so that my experience can help people who think ""I am just an ordinary person, I can't change the system, I can't protest against injustice."" or ""They are rich and corrupt, so there is no way to bring them to justice, so I should better move on with my life and do nothing"" or ""All the problems is due to the current system/government and I can't do anything about it"".

I was a no one in this incident. I didn't know the victim. I was not even a student of that college at that time. I was an ex-student. I had no ""benefit"" in doing any of this. Also, I did all of it anonymously. No one except about 5 friends know that I was working behind the scenes. 

Also, my major contribution was in directing the protest, contacting the right people, managing the information and running the campaign. I did majority of it by just sitting in a room with a laptop. There were hundreds of other brave people who staged the protest and did the things which I wanted to be done.

I didn't start out thinking I will coordinate this protest or spend so much time on it. This all started out when I started a Facebook page asking justice for the victim. I regularly posted new content and people started contacting me with new information or asking me what they should do. Within few days, I was having so much contact with so many people from various backgrounds like students, teachers, reporters, lawyers, ex-students, parents etc that I unknowingly became the one who was running the entire campaign both online and offline.

So many people selflessly helped in finding information. Some law students of other colleges volunteered to write legal notices or other such stuff. Some people traveled great distances to find certain information. Some people had contacts with politicians and was able to mobilize partymen. Some brought in media. Some were reporters who were directly taking content from me and posting it. Some were helping in the creation of the content. And, I had to ensure that the content I was providing is true.

After about a month of work, it started showing signs of success. We started to get the attention of mainstream media who started posting the full details without censoring anything. Then, few weeks later, this became the headline news of all the newspapers in the state. It became the talk of the town. I overheard so many people discussing about this incident while travelling in trains or buses.

Then, student protests broke out at many private colleges across the state demanding student unions and fighting against injustices. Few colleges even lost their affiliation and closed down due to this incident. And, students of one such engineering college was transferred to better colleges. My friends and relatives at several other colleges said that the situation has improved after this incident.

I had a choice to make about 10 years ago, to move out of India and I chose not to. Mostly because my friend circle, my gf, and most of my family was in India at the time. I found a job in a great company that kickstarted my career fairly well. 


Due in part to my own existential crisis, due in part to a change in outlook around 6 years ago(post MBA) and due in part to everything that has been happening in the country for the last few years, I gradually started finding living in the country to be unbearable. This is not an anti-BJP post by any means. I've never been political and I do not see myself ever being. I do have ideologies which at the very core is ""Live and let live""....or to be blunt....Unfortunately and I'm sure a lot of you agree, the Indian society simply isn't going to let you do that. Its not that I was living a loud/flamboyant life. Its that even the simple life I tried to live was being threatened in several ways. 

This group, r/india though often negative in tone has also helped open my eyes to a lot of things. This discourse is important, if for nothing else, as an outlet for folks who are frustrated. For folks to empathize and sympathize.

At this point, we begin a change in tone...........

I saw my friends, colleagues and classmates gradually all leave the country. Some of them left around 8-10 years ago. None of them show a genuine interest in returning. But this didn't really bother me. I still had a great friends circle and I've always been exceptionally great and keeping in touch with my friends and meeting them every chance I get. Nothing was changing my mind that I needed to move out. 

But one day, something just snapped. I spoke to a friend of mine over dinner. She was a classmate from college. She had been working with a firm in Australia. See the thing is, she and I never spoke in college but we just knew each other. I saw on fb that she was in town, we got chatting and decided to meet up. She was asking why I don't look for opportunities abroad. I said I never felt that things are necessarily that much better there. She said she could potentially find me a job. 

I found out that she and I were in similar industries. She was earning(post-conversion) around 60L more than me. I told her that really doesn't matter given living costs. She told me she 'saves' roughly 20 LPA. And believe me, she's not someone who tries to save. This was a time when I was commuting about 90 minutes one way to work. 8km. She travels 20 minutes to work and can afford to stay away from the central/expensive parts of the city due to great public transport. 

She lives a healthy and fun life. Has co-workers who know to stick to their boundaries. Has no one bother her about what she wears, who she's with, what she eats etc. I couldn't find a single objective measure, to counter her with. 

I made it my life's mission to find out for myself whether this was all truly the case. So I started looking out. Thankfully, my wife was offered a perfectly timed transfer to a western country for 2 years and that came with a Visa for me as well. And so I took the leap. Found myself a job before I landed here. 

Its been a few months now and I've finally seen what this other side is like today. This is an abrupt end to this post but that's because there's too much to write if I explained everything else.

So feel free now to ask me anything you want about my thoughts/experiences.

Some inside information about the 'support letter' situation in Maharashtra,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1btyt/some_inside_information_about_the_support_letter/,15,AMA,0,e1btyt,1574691059.0,goldenGhostBanri,"I hope everyone is well aware about the political situation in Maharashtra right now. I will post TL;dr about the situation regardless.

\- No party has the majority

\- BJP fails to maintain the government

\- Shivsena isn't able to form a goverment

\- Presidents rule is applied

\- Shivsena + NCP + Congress prepares to form the government on Saturday afternoon

\- BJP + Ajit Pawar of NCP forms the government secretly at 5AM in the morning of the Saturday.

&#x200B;

The government is allowed to be formed by the Governor because Ajit Pawar produced a letter of support with signatures of all the MLA's of NCP. Now the missing link in the story was how did Ajit Pawar was able to get this letter when NCP was about to give support to Shivsena.

The reason behind this is, NCP prepared 4 letters in total. 1 was to provide support to ShivSena. 1 was to provide support to Congress. 1 was to claim the support of other parties to form their own government and the last one was to provide support to BJP. All these letters were with Ajit Pawar as he was the leader of NCP. Fadnavis Blackmailed Ajit Pawar on Friday Midnight which forced him to give this letter to Fadnavis and allowed him to form the government. Sharad Pawar is well aware of this as just a day before he was with Mr. Modi to talk about 'Farmers'. The situation became comical as Shiv Sena wasn't aware of this 4 letters existing and thus to save face, the 'letter was forged' argument is created.

Also, AMA I guess."

[AMA] I am a spiritually awakened person from Pune here to offer assistance to troubled souls in these challenging times. Ask Me Anything!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8o1tqa/ama_i_am_a_spiritually_awakened_person_from_pune/,111,AMA,5,8o1tqa,1527986769.0,AscendWithAseim,"**Please read this before you proceed:** One: Just because I'm spiritually awakened, *does not mean* that I ""know everything"". I'm learning and growing *every day* as much as (if not more than) you or anyone else in here and this learning is meant to be an infinite journey, be it for you or for me or for anyone else. Two: I will try to answer all questions, except for questions to which I quite frankly have *no answers to*. There are plenty of areas within the human experience that I have little to no experience with, and I'll *not* talk about things I don't know jackshit about because hypocrisy/fakery isn't my branch of expertise. Three: And this is the most important thing. Please do not take my words as gospel just because I'm ""woke"" - for what I have to offer is but a different perspective than what you may have considered before. Use your own discernment, logic, intuition and experimentation to see what works for you and what doesn't. Even if you think that I'm a complete fake, all I ask is that you at least read what I have to say with an open mind, take what works for you and trash what doesn't. Because as right or wrong as I could be, no two people have the same paths towards attaining spiritual awakening. So, even if what I have to offer in terms of an advice is appropriate for, say, 10 out of 100 people; there are still always going to be 90 others who will find no relevance in my words. That does not necessarily mean that I'm being a fraudulent cunt, it would just mean that 90 others have different ways of going about things, which is a *perfectly valid thing*.

**Why *Is* AMA?**  

Humanity as a whole is headed towards some pretty fucking challenging times ahead and some truly unpleasant and shattering revelations about the nature of the reality that they are living in. A lot of those challenging situations are already presenting themselves in every way even at personal levels, just look at all of the fear, negativity, sadness and depression in any of the Reddit threads; or anywhere else on the internet for that matter. The internet is just a smaller reflection of the greater reality and planetary consciousness. And then, there are all of these changes that are also now rapidly taking place across people's lives, and will shortly be taking place across national, global and even greater scales than that. All I wish to do here is to assist anyone going through troubled times (who is at least willing to listen to a fresh perspective) because it would honestly be such a waste if I knew all of these cool things and was ultimately unable to help anyone when they truly needed it. Not happening on my watch.  

Thank you for your time.  

**P.S.** Even after this AMA is over, I'll be there to assist any of you who are at all interested in the same through the direct messaging feature. Hope that helps.  

**EDIT 1:** Please keep asking questions even though seeing my replies may take some time; mainly because I tend to write really long-ass replies. I prefer to be really comprehensive about this, hope you'll understand.  

**EDIT 2:** For all those who are interested in knowing more about what happens after death and things such as how ""soul contracts"" that we make prior to incarnation upon this planet work, you are most welcome to visit the [""Exceptional Experiences"" section (link)](http://www.nderf.org/Archives/exceptional.html) of the NDERF (Near Death Experience Research Foundation) experience contribution repository. You'll find it to be extremely fascinating, and get more info than you'd have possibly bargained for.

I'm pretty sure anyone can do it if they simply focused. Hope this helps.  

**EDIT 4:** To all of the people who only have to mock what I have to say in here and are busy contributing nothing positive to the discussion, I would love to ask, what pleasure does doing so give you? Look through my posts and you'll realise that not only have I been up all night (and right back now that it's morning!) to make sure that every question I've been asked gets answered, but also I've made sure to answer nearly every question (including some of the openly ill-intentioned ones) to their fullest detail wherever I can, even though it has taken me *hours* to do so. And (so far as I can see) I haven't tried to sell or market a single thing to anyone, or as much as mentioned my name. **There have been ""stickied AMAs"" in here that have answered 1% of your (hundreds of) questions in 1 line at best, that too, only to promote some products or agendas or for profits (PC AMA, anyone?).** At least I'm not doing that. At least I'm being sincere about what I have to offer even though my post has gotten such little visibility (due to not being stickied). I'm not asking for your respect here, all I'm asking is that you not deter others who are genuinely interested in asking/answering questions and the pursuit of truth by being so *mean* to them. Is that really too much to ask for? I leave it to you to answer."

Hey everyone!

I am Jaya Ramchandani. I am a science communicator and have recently started to teach IB physics and general science.

I have been working with innovative educational projects making astronomy and physics accessible to the general public. 

Today, I am here to answer questions related to interdisciplinary projects like art meets science, informal, out-of-the classroom learning, and lifelong learning for all.

I co-founded 'The Story Of' Foundation because while studying physics I found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are similar to Eastern philosophy. So I started to ask the question then, why doesn’t contemporary science talk more often to Eastern philosophy? That was one of the bigger motivations behind setting up the platform. We involved artists and designers in a big way because they are great at thinking about abstract topics and giving them form.

You can see our past project The Story of Light 2015 here: www.thestoryoflight.org. The Story of Light received international recognition in the UN’s International Year of Light education and outreach panel. 

In the upcoming project, The Story of Space 2017, http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/ we welcome everyone to join us in Goa from 10th November to 19th November for our festival. The Story of Space provides unique learning experiences around space exploration, migration, urban architecture and other contemporary issues associated with the word ‘space’. Essentially, we explore ‘space’ from multiple perspectives. Artists, scientists, educators, and philosophers have all come to Goa to create live experiences, a film program, installations, workshops, talks, and panels. The 10-day festival is for the general public, across generations, and is FREE for all to experience. Story of Space 2017.

We are a Non-profit NGO and are a volunteer run project. You can make contributions on our page (link below). If you can't give anything but still want to support our cause please share our link with your friends, family and co-workers. With more people aware of our cause, we will be one step closer to our goal. Donate - http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/donate

I will keep checking this thread to see if there is any further question and try to reply back. Thanks so much once again!

In April 2017, we took a 3 day tour to North Korea and visited their capital city Pyongyang. This included my wife, our 3 year old son and myself.

Surprisingly there have not been many Indian tourists visiting this secluded country and we would love to see other fellow Indians sharing their experiences as well.

Please feel free to ask any question that can help to plan your trip to DPRK or satisfy your curiosity. 

Thanks!

Would have loved to question him about why he thinks it is a good idea and why he is risking tarnishing his legacy by putting his weight behind a dumpster fire like aadhaar.

Can we collectively form a couple of questions for him and ask him about it next time he does the AMA. It was over before most of India woke up and even then there was much bigger news to distract us :P

P.S. It probably doesn't deserve it's own post but I could not think of a better way to bring this to everybody's notice so that at least one of us asks him about it."

[Answer](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28js8v/i_am_julian_assange_publisher_of_wikileaks_ask_me/cibl7dh/):

> The election of Modi is a very interesting development in Indian democracy. We have released many interesting documents on Modi's ascension to power, you can see them here: (just search for 'Modi') https://wikileaks.org/plusd and https://search.wikileaks.org. **From these materials it's clear Modi can be most accurately described as a ""business authoritarian""**. Whether Indian needs a stronger centre to compete with China is an open question. Inevitably strong leaders make mistakes and eventually lose their faculties. **Other than his extensive big business alliances, I think it is an open question as to whether Modi will bring more good than bad to India**.

I'm a bit nervous doing this since I'm not famous or have done anything significantly noteworthy, but I did get asked a few times to do an AMA so here goes!

Here's a brief synopsis of my life, and you can ask me whatever you wish to ask from a phase of life. Proof can be provided as needed :)

I was born in a middle class family in Punjab. I was always one of those kids who was shit in sports and good in studies. I was always a 90+ student. Till the time I took PCM. Fuck.That.Shit. I gave up on studying for Indian examinations and gave the SATs and IELTS so I could try for universities abroad. I got decent scores in my foreign examinations and while I was planning on applying to universities in Canada(I'm punjabi), I heard of this university in China and I said ""hey! let's do something different"". My dad had some work relations in China too, and that helped me solidify the decision.

**China:** I dread thinking about my time back there because of how much I miss that place. China is a heaven for those willing to experiment, explore and immerse themselves in an odd culture. It's equally tough for those looking for ""an easy time abroad"". I spent 4 years of my undergrad at the [University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.edu.cn/). Its one of the top 100 unis in the world with a campus in China. It's relatively expensive, but affordable by the Western standards. I didn't want to take too much money from my parents, so they used to pay for my tuition + accomodation, and I took care of my living+ overheads for the most part in the following ways

* Part time teacher/model(LOL)

* Middleman/agent for my friends looking for jobs

* Bootlegging

* Reselling / pawning old discarded dorm stuff

In China, I learned the bliss that is to travel. Ive travelled almost everywhere in China, and a fair few places apart from that. My travel time in Vietnam changed me, and I honestly regard that trip for making me who I am today. 

**Right now**

I'm working with my family. We have a well established business and I love work, though I hate my city. Been back in India for 6 months now. [I aquascape!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mekcn/askindia_i_have_a_unique_skill_and_a_strange/) and I am on reddit way more than I should be.

The walk is a project of the Veditum India Foundation, and is being undertaken independently by me. A team from our production partner Digital Nerve comprising of Ayan Sil and Rahul Mitra are filming a documentary and capturing photographs. Ardra Venugopal, a Veditum fellow is working on cross sector research in relation to the river and the people living alongside it. We are recording real life experiences of people and the vivid sounds of nature, documenting success stories and that of distress related to the river, collecting social & scientific data and bringing out a first person narrative of the river as a co-living entity, if not the protagonist that it is. The idea is to use research in vivid ways to capture the attention of the audience and speak to them of the state of affairs, not just qualitatively but quantitatively as well. The project provides a platform to collect data for environmental research being conducted across the nation in various institutes.


We are walking along this route [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1fBlKd3W5vPbbwgH0G6TDK604kSw]


In the past, i have had the opportunity to cycle from Calcutta to Mumbai (2500kms), working on issues of Child Labour, Child Education and Micro Lending with CRY and Rang De. I also walked 700kms across Rajasthan, highlighting the cause of Shekhawati Architecture and trying to understand Micro Lending issues in this region as well. Through these endeavours, we could raise both funds and awareness for the mentioned causes, translating directly into impact at many fronts.

 It has over 55000 followers on facebook and has been prominently featured in various newspapers who have also quoted it as a source to dispel fake stories. The founder has also delivered a talk at TEDx Surat on the topic of fake news and the need for critical thinking and common sense when it comes to believing what you read or see on the internet.

PS: Every rule is being enforced to this day.

Edit: Every word of it is true!. Thanks [/u/_anniyan](https://www.reddit.com/user/_anniyan).

""even i am an alumnus of sairam engg college bro. you forgot to mention about how much fines they levy for each and everything. for eg., 10000 INR for being caught with a cellphone (also the cellphone will be confiscated), 2000 INR for being caught copying during a class-test, 50 INR for being late or taking a day off or forgetting the ID card, etc. the ID cards will be seized (which can only be recovered by paying 50 INR as fine) and the corresponding students will be abused by badwords (like slt, whre, bstrd) if caught talking to the opposite gender. let the world know how much black money they amass by such means. let me clear a few things here: mr. balu (the head thug : so-called campus incharge) has power to abuse anyone using badwords - be it the staff, the HODs, the principal, the students, the parents, if he deems it necessary. and you forgot the ""dark room"" where he calls students to lock them up inside and beat them up using lathis or shoes if he deems it necessary. every dayscholar must compulsorily eat their lunch (which tastes crappy) in the mess only and pay an unreasonable yearly amount for it, and cannot bring their own food unless they have a letter of exemption signed by mr.balu. no exemption permitted to dayscholars to come to college by their own vehicle (they must use the college buses only for which they have to pay an unreasonably hefty sum)."""

I am Tathagata Satpathy, elected Member of Parliament and Chief Whip of Biju Janata Dal in Lok Sabha. This is the 4th time I am serving as an MP (12th, 14th, 15th & 16th Lok Sabha). I am a journalist by profession and I am the editor of two newspapers, Dharitri (Oriya) and Orissa POST (English).

[AMA Proof image]( http://imgur.com/rrdJgI9)

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

EDIT (19:53 IST, March 20, 2015): I got some brilliant points from Redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already! After a not so busy week in parliament, let me try answering a few more questions.

I was doing B.Tech civil(3 year's).I had done a Diploma engineering.I was ranked 723/23000 in diploma CET.I took a college in my place of residence.My year of admission was 2003

I changed.I missed classes,told lies,flunked in exams badly.All due to a girl,who i was infatuated with .I chased her ,till heaven.

I don't want to go into details but,severe depression & suicidal tendencies meant i failed in college ,twice.

After failing twice, the girl was stalked,harassed& i did some unfortunate things.

I was convicted on IPC 306,323,354,506.Spent nearly 5 years in prison.

My family deserted me,no friends,no financial support,except a diploma .Couldnt get into any government job,since criminal antecedents.

So i moved 1500 kms away from residence in 2010.

I worked as a driver of a local businessman.My pay was 2500/month.

I used to wash vehicles in a affluent neighbourhood,about 7-8 cars,which got me extra rupees more/month.

I survived,barely.I had many goals.I wanted to study law& become a lawyer.I didn't have courage to risk such thing,when finance was bare minimum.

Back to 2013,after toiling hard labour work for nearly 3 year's,i said to myself,is this what you wanted in your life? I could see my college mates,working in MNC's,moving abroad& enjoying their lives.

My pay in 2013 was about 6500/month.

On November 24th,2013,my life changed,changed for good.It was my birthday.I was rewarded by my then Late Sir(Don't want to name him) .He said me,I'm well skilled enough & a diploma holder,speak good English.He asked me whether i would want to work in his stock brokerage firm.

Life certainly changed for good.He provided me huge support,took care like a child& i stayed with him till 2015,when i decided to become a stock trader .

So come 2017,i am doing financially good,live in a gated society apartment,own a 4 wheeler as well.

I've not seen my family since 2007,nor they've got in touch with me.It hurts.

Here's my daily schedule:

06-Wake up,yoga
07:30-B'fast 
09-16:00-On trading 
16:30-Sleep
18:00-Sit in a park
19-00-Cook Dinner
20:00-Tv
23:00-Sleep

I don't have any friends,nor anyone who cares about me i guess.I feel lonely.

On Saturday,i teach nearby kids from neglected section of society,from 9-13:00

Life has been hard,but i changed myself very quickly & definitely must say I've succeeded .

You can ask me anything.I will answer patiently."

Here is the verification if you need it: https://twitter.com/redditindia/status/569747921396244480

Besides my work as an actor, TV host & singer (and an ex-Dentist), I am into adventure & a whole lot of traveling. Sky diving, quad bike racing, shark cage diving are some of the activities I have indulged in in the past (apart from the gamut of new ""stunts"" I had to perform on my show recently). There is still so much to do & achieve in this lifetime. 

I love my food & those who cook for me. I am a closet cartoonist and an avid reader in my leisure hours. And now that we've made this acquaintance....

AMA!

"Hi Reddit, i'm Siddharth Agarwal & i'm currently on a walk (~3000kms) along the river Ganga from sea to source and i have already walked 2000kms since 6th June. AmA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/566cwa/hi_reddit_im_siddharth_agarwal_im_currently_on_a/,67,AMA,246,566cwa,1475801415.0,iamasid,"This June, I started walking along the Ganga from the ocean to the glaciers at 14000 feet, trying to present a very personal narrative of the Ganga and stories of the people who affect and are affected by it. The experiences have maintained my understanding that there’s a need to bring these important conversations into the mainstream. This campaign will help us learn and share with you stories of the people of the basin who depend on the river and what urban/rural/industrial activities are doing to the river.

Last time we did an AmA [https://redd.it/4saxeh] i had covered 500kms and was waiting to sort out some logistical issues to continue the journey. 

Current status :

I'm done with over 75% of the journey and it has been an exceptionally challenging task over the course of the past 4 months. For those who have been following the journey from the beginning, it might come as a surprise that i have been by myself and not accompanied by a documentary crew as was the case when i started (refer to previous AmA). Restricted by personal reasons and security concerns, the crew decided to drop out after they had covered the stretch in West Bengal. Though this affected the design of the project as envisioned and also induced a fair bit of mental agony, it helped me re-emphasize my belief that the only limitations are the ones that we put on ourselves.

What this has done though, is that it helped me survive longer on the road with the same amount of funds we were able to raise in the first round of crowdfunding. We'll soon be going live with a second round of crowdfunding, since the first round didn’t reach our target and use that to support the Moving Upstream series of projects, which is soon going to witness an expansion. This includes an opportunity for more young people to undergo river journeys with the support of Veditum India Foundation, to help us understand, visualize and thereby improve the situation at the grassroots.

"[AMA] Hello r/india, I am u/_vi5in_'s grandfather (the one with the British passport issued to him before India became independent) AMA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4vyacc/ama_hello_rindia_i_am_u_vi5in_s_grandfather_the/,103,AMA,152,4vyacc,1470257004.0,_vi5in_,"Hello, r/india!

This AMA is on behalf of my grandfather. A few days ago [I posted](http://imgur.com/a/rQ210) pictures of his pre-Independence British Passport that was issued to him when he had to travel to the Middle East in early 1947. The post generated a lot of interest and people had questions for him and requested an AMA.

I've frequently talked to him about his experiences and he has told me bits and pieces over the years. It's really fascinating to listen to because it was a completely-different time, and it's amazing listening to someone who actually lived through those times.

My grandfather is 93 years old. He went to UC College in Aluva, but didn't finish his degree, instead deciding to run away and join the military. He took a train from Chennai to Lahore for basic training, and then went to Bombay for a Wireless Operators Course. After that he spent a few months in Hyderabad where he was promoted to Sergeant. 

He was then posted to Ramree Island off the coast of Burma with the 4th squadron of the Royal Indian Air force to help them conduct recce operations against the Imperial Japanese Army. After the end of the war he was offered a chance to be part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, but instead opted to leave the military.

He worked for Kodak for a bit and then was offered a job with the Iraq Petroleum Company, which he took. This was when he was issued his passport. 

Because of his age and because he recently had some surgery he gets easily tired and I don't want to exert him too much. As a result he won't be able to answer your questions immediately. But please do post them and I will start going over them tomorrow morning and will transcribe his answers. Also, there are some details he can't remember so I apologize in advance if he is not able to answer some of your questions.

[Ask him anything!](http://imgur.com/0m8sek0)

Also, [proof](http://imgur.com/J6yEqca).

**EDIT**: It is **9:00 AM** IST right now. My grandpa let me know that he has a doctor's appointment, but we should be back by around **10:15 AM** IST or so to answer the rest of the questions. Sorry for the delay, but he is still very interested in answering the questions! 

**UPDATE 1**: My grandpa is back!

**UPDATE 2**: Taking a break for lunch - will come back after.

**UPDATE 3**: Back after lunch and I've transcribed his responses to all of the other remaining questions. I'm finishing up now because my grandfather is getting tired (he's already coughing a little bit after talking so much). I'm sorry if we were unable to answer all your questions! My grandfather thanks you all and I want to thank the r/india mods for helping me organize this AMA and the r/india community for making it a success. I've wanted to collect his thoughts and experiences from those years and this AMA really helped me do that well. Thank you all again!"

"Hello /r/india. I am Urjit Yajnik, former Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA), IIT Bombay (circa 2011-15). AMA",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3c76fm/hello_rindia_i_am_urjit_yajnik_former_dean_of/,275,AMA,201,3c76fm,1436136378.0,dosa_iitb,"Hello All,  
This is Urjit Yajnik, Physics Professor, but also the unenviable erstwhile Dean of Student Affairs, IIT Bombay from roughly during 2011 to 2015, a position fondly or otherwise called DoSA.  

Here is the [proof](https://i.imgur.com/bMcINPp.png).

I have agreed to do AMA with due encouragement and prodding by [InsIghT](https://www.facebook.com/insight.iitbombay), our own loveable if noisome media body. And they have offered to stand by me through this session, as much as media stand by officials, I guess.

Let me set the ball rolling by what is on my mind as I face the large general body of people but majority of whom are most likely the sufferers of my ""regime"". I am opening up in this particular session to questions that are related to   

* Matters pertaining to IIT Bombay; more generally to the IIT system  
* Higher technological education, in India and worldwide  
* General issues about career choices, future of the relationship between technology and society and what, with my limited crystal ball gazing abilities, may be your available strategies to navigate that.  

To kick off, let me make three points :  

1. What was my abiding motto for handing the DoSA job? It was that students of IIT Bombay and of a campus and academic environment similar to IIT Bombay should live in a self-governed, participatory environment. As you know we have no resident wardens in individual hostels, though the faculty Wardens are only a stone’s throw away. I relied mostly on the fact that students have a responsibility to their own lives and those of
their fellow residents of the campus. And I received ample justification to this belief, in the initiatives and tasks that student representatives or individuals took up, sometimes for the larger student body but often also just for that individual who needed help the most. 

2. IIT Bombay is at present blazing a trail. From the exposure to faculty research output, to the inspiration and infrastructure they receive from IIT Bombay, students and alumni have made the most to put the Institute in the forefront. A large number of alumni and well wishers have also devoted substantial amounts of time and resources to make this happen. We see the culture of fundamental contributions to technology, to management and innovation, as well as to entrepreneurship to grow in the time to come.

3. Career choices. As the world becomes both information loaded and also small in terms of the rapidity and reach of ideas and products, it becomes a challenge to decide how to steer and navigate through this environment. So long as you navigate yourself ethically and are making a definite contribution to the  larger good, you are fine.

Well, so those are the thoughts with which I start. Now let's AMA away!


**[Volunteer's note: Prof. Yajnik will start answering questions at around 9.30 pm. Feel free to post your questions till then]**

**EDIT:** The AMA is now done. Prof. Yajnik spent about five hours on this, answering 50 questions. Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as we did :D"

i believe that every good coder should get into freelancing, since there is lot of money to be made. there is still shortage of developers & despite competition you can make handsome money. 

so how much? idiots i know, who cant code for shit, making 13-15 l/y. how? cos there is always shortage & there is lot of grunt/shitty work. since americans pay in dollars, you will earn a lot

so why freelancing? indian companies are mostly shit. i worked in a IT service like infosys, work was shit, pay was shit. worked in a startup, work was okay, pay was super shit. unless you are getting nice equity & u can bet on the startup, don't bother working in a startup. its a nice strategy to make people work for shitty salaries.

secondly, u can work from anywhere. you will have full control over your business. 

about me: i have about 9 years of programming experience now, but i started freelancing 7 years ago. i have coded in many major languages/frameworks. but i mostly done java/php/python/js. I stopped freelancing 3 years ago, to join a startup. but i was making 25-26 l/y, comfortably (i.e taking breaks). in my best years, i have made upto 60 l/y.

In the last 9 years in Parliament, I have taken up issues that range from the welfare of our Veterans and Armed forces, the Economy, Crony capitalists, push for Governance reforms, and also issues like the 2G and other scams.


I have a passion for all things Technology including internet and technology policy, and firmly believe that technology can transform Indian Politics and Governance, our democracy and lives of all citizens. I believe that an enabling internet policy ecosystem, including a neutral internet, is crucial to the success of Digital India.


I have worked as a Chip designer at Intel and worked on the 80486 and Pentium chips, Set up one of the first and largest Greenfield Indian cellular service BPL mobile, and then transitioned into being a technology entrepreneur. As an MP, I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A of the IT Act, which was struck down earlier this year.


I believe that the current debate on Net Neutrality is a result of the failure of our previous Governments r to initiate a robust multi-stakeholder discussion on Internet Governance  model based structure for Internet Governance. For over three years now, I have argued that we must strive to create a multi-stakeholder based model for Internet Governance,  which would have also resulted in a conclusion and debate of Net neutrality. 

I am doing this AMA to:
1.	Take a stab at addressing specific queries on the nuances of the Net Neutrality debate in India.
2.	Take any inputs from this chat back into Parliament and other interventions I shall be making with the Government on the issue, and
3.	Reinforce my commitment to the Net Neutrality fight and make my pro-neutrality position clear.
Here's a link that will take you to all my articles and interventions on Net Neutrality, including my 30 page submission to TRAI's infamous consultation paper: http://rajeev.in/NetNeutrality.html
