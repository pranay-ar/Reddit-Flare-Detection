During the first hearing on 9 April, the Court issued notice to the Standing Counsel for Government of Jammu & Kashmir. The matter was listed again today i.e. 21 April and the Court directed the Government to file a reply to the petition by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April. \\n\\n### Background\\n\\nFoundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March. The petition was first listed for hearing before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J on 9 April. During the hearing on 9 April, the bench issued notice to the Standing Counsel of Government of Jammu & Kashmir. Read more about the petition and last hearing [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-issues-notice-in-fmps-petition-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-jammu-kashmir-during-covid-19-crisis/).\\n\\nSubsequent to the petition being filed on 31 March, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir continued to direct ISPs to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G through orders issued under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. These orders issued on 3 April and 15 April were also challenged by the Petitioner by filing additional applications. \\n\\n### Practical Impact of the Internet Slowdown\\n\\nIn addition to challenging subsequent internet slowdown orders, the Petitioner also sought to bring on record personal narratives of hardships faced by doctors, teachers, students, journalists, advocates etc in Jammu & Kashmir due to the internet slowdown. FMP‚Äôs Director and veteran journalist, Ms. Revati Laul personally spoke to 13 residents of Jammu & Kashmir to collect these narratives.\\n\\n>*‚ÄúI have so many patients who are just able to call me this time. I can‚Äôt understand what they are trying to tell me exactly...One said,I have pain in the tummy. The tummy is big. It has around 20 organs inside. So then I ask ‚Äì is it the upper part of the tummy, is it the right side, is it lower? And it becomes very difficult. It‚Äôs not possible to accurately pin-point what they‚Äôre saying.‚Äù* \\\\-Doctor at Srinagar Government Medical College on need for video facilities  \\n>  \\n>*‚ÄúThe universities will hold their exams on time. Then no one will speak on our behalf to say to them ‚Äì oh, there was no 4G, there were no classes. There will only be exams. Did we get any education? Are teachers being sent to our homes? Is there a door to door drive to ensure that students‚Äô education won‚Äôt be affected?\"* \\\\- Student at Degree College in Bemina\\n\\nThe Petitioner also produced a comparative analysis of web performance at 2G and 4G speed to help the Court fully understand the practical consequences of the internet slowdown. This technical report was authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre, a technologist and policy researcher who had previously also analysed functionality of whitelisted websites in Jammu & Kashmir. The analysis revealed that tasks on observed 2G speed can take upto 50 times longer and 2G network conditions were well below the minimum requirements of video streaming/video communication platforms like YouTube, Zoom and Skype. In addition to this theoretical analysis, Mr. Waghre also carried out a simulated test which found that some interactive interfaces like the World Health Organization‚Äôs Situation Tracker did not function at observed 2G speeds at all. \\n\\n### What happened at today‚Äôs hearing?\\n\\nDuring today‚Äôs hearing, the bench inquired about a suo moto petition pending before the Jammu & Kashmir High Court on the same issue. In response to this, the Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta indicated that he requires time to seek more information about the suo moto petition and suggested that it may also be transferred to the Supreme Court. \\n\\nThe Court also sought information about the total number of COVID-19 cases in Jammu & Kashmir. Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for FMP informed the Court that the region had 354 COVID-19 cases. He emphasized that this was a matter of grave urgency and the Government had not filed its response despite notice being issued on 9 April. Therefore, he requested the Court to direct the Government to file its reply expeditiously.\\n\\nThe Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal sought to justify the internet slowdown by claiming that the region had a serious militancy problem. However, the bench directed the Government to file a proper written response and record its submissions on affidavit. The Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta accepted this direction and indicated that the Government will file a consolidated report. \\n\\nIn addition to FMP‚Äôs petition, two more petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services filed by Soayib Quereshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir were also listed for hearing today. Advocate Charu Ambwani representing the Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir highlighted how the education of 27 lakh students was being hampered because they did not have access to high speed internet. In response to a question by the bench, she also stated that most students in Jammu & Kashmir have laptops and tablets so the biggest hurdle is slow internet speed. \\n\\nAfter hearing submissions made by all counsels, the bench directed the Government to file a reply by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April. \\n\\n### Important Documents\\n\\n1.

Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it\\'s not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, \"would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn\\'t home\". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn\\'t strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else\\'s bike.\\nThese people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.\\n\\nNow about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. \\nLast month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.\\nThis month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.\\nAfter the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.\\nNow, on the second and third day they didn\\'t change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn\\'t provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. \\nHis bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.\\nAnd for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it\\'s us who is making the mistake.\\nAnd to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.\\n\\nAfter the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?\\nThese officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. \\nTruth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.\\n\\nTLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.\\nBtw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad\\'s healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.', '', 'My job requires me to make a bunch of phone call - and the covid awareness message plays for a while for pretty much every call I make and it‚Äôs super annoying after a point.

For example i\\'ve met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).\\n\\nSome of the things I\\'ve noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a \"lie, cheat or steal\" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLike for example i\\'m from a third world country and it\\'s okay, got no problem with that.

So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. \\nSince 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.\\n\\n\\n###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM\\n\\nA Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.

So credit to him for these parts.\\n\\n>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.\\n\\n>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).\\n\\n>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?\\n\\n>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it\\'s peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.\\n\\n>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!\\n\\nSo ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. \\nPersonally, i hope CPM just dies. \\n\\n\\n###Dilip Ghosh, BJP\\n\\nObviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP.

They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.\\n\\nShe took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.\\n\\nHer 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. \\n\\n>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.\\n\\n>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal\\'s economy? No, she hasn\\'t. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.\\n\\n>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.\\n\\n>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her \"Kanyashree\" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don\\'t talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all.

Probably not.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.\\n\\n>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!\\n\\nNOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)\\n\\nI actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM\\'s of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray.

Or disillusionment with science?', '', '', '', \"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)\\n\\nNarendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  \\n\\n*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* \\n\\nIn a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhi‚Äôs Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: ‚ÄúWhy is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capital‚Äôs catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?‚Äù\\n\\nIn answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores ‚Äúon a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhi‚Äôs pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the people‚Äôs good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.‚Äù\\n\\nThe [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishore‚Äôs article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firm‚Äôs previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their execution\\xa0 ‚Äúupon the removal of  ‚Äúobstacles‚Äù like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practices‚Äù. The firm‚Äôs past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting ‚Äúan innate disrespect for the  citizen‚Äù.\\n\\nIn concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:\\n\\n‚ÄúThe biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs Elys√©es? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: ‚ÄòIt brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayer‚Äôs expense.‚Äù\\n\\nKishore‚Äôs essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.\\n\\nIn fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.\\n\\nAlso read: [In Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Central Vista Project Should Be Reviewed](https://thewire.in/urban/covid-19-central-vista-project-new-delhi)\\n\\nThe prime minister‚Äôs own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone ‚Äì the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldn‚Äôt quite do  for Narendra Modi.\\n\\nTo my mind, the Modi government‚Äôs redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  ruler‚Äôs immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean B√©del-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaul‚Äôs essay ‚Äò[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)‚Äô).\\n\\nEven before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  \\n\\nAs many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why can‚Äôt the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme ‚Äì estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting ‚Äì be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?\\n\\nPolitically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money ‚Äì not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?\\n\\nAlso read: [What a Comparison of Great Central Vistas Tells Us About Modi‚Äôs Plans for New Delhi](https://thewire.in/urban/what-a-comparison-of-great-central-vistas-tells-us-about-modis-plans-for-new-delhi)\\n\\nIt will be at least a year ‚Äì probably longer ‚Äì before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.\\n\\nIn his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice ‚Äì sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.\\n\\n*Postscript: While spiking this particular article, the* Hindustan Times  *left open the possibility of my continuing to write on other (and  presumably from the paper‚Äôs point of view safer) subjects.

It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.\\n\\n  \\nThere have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India\\'s success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.\\n\\nToday, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).\\n\\nI was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):\\n\\n1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).\\n2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.\\n\\nMoreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The \"cause of death\" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))\\n\\nGiven these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. \\n\\nThese are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Hello,\\n\\nThe study is being conducted under the supervision of my professor.

In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.\\n\\nYou can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?\\n\\nI am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.\\n\\nWhat do y'all think?

In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper‚Äôs analysis of the partnership through the lens of what‚Äôs good, possible risks and the project‚Äôs relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.\\n\\n### Background | The Promise of Scale and Privacy\\n\\nEven as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world‚Äôs two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.\\n\\nThe companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.\\n\\nThis development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.\\n\\nIn particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.\\n\\n### Proposed Timelines\\n\\nDemonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.\\n\\n1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.\\n2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.\\n\\n### The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy\\n\\nTo reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.\\n\\nComing to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required. \\xa0Similar to Singapore‚Äôs *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFF‚Äôs Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user‚Äôs device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people‚Äôs privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu app‚Äôs own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.\\n\\nShould an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their ‚Äúclose proximity‚Äù interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual‚Äôs phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person‚Äôs phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.\\n\\nThe project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.\\n\\n### Risks Arising from the Project\\n\\nOne of the large outcomes of the coronavirus‚Äô impact in relation to people‚Äôs increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people‚Äôs movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.\\n\\nWhen private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people‚Äôs fundamental rights to informational privacy.\\n\\nStringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.\\n\\n* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people‚Äôs personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations. \\xa0Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.\\n* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project‚Äôs first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions. \\xa0Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.\\n* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.\\n\\n### Relevance for India and What‚Äôs Next?\\n\\nIt is important to highlight that India‚Äôs Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF‚Äôs submission will address the whitepaper/consultation‚Äôs interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.\\n\\nBased on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.\\n\\n### Links to IFF‚Äôs COVID-19 Related Work\\n\\n1.

Questions in the bottom of the post.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.\\n\\nI was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.\\n\\nFast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. \\n\\nMy concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.\\n\\nI wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.\\n\\nMy questions to you-\\n1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600\\n2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?\\n2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?\\n3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional?
